They are great to begin with and for several months. Then the under-engineered case starts deteriorating.  Side opens up when charging and the button departs.  Mine is now held together with rubberbands and is very hard to operate as the on/off button does not align with the switch.  Sides of case material made too thin. Probably made that way to save weight.  They do still work when I can turn them on.,3.0,they are great to begin with and for several months then the underengineered case starts deteriorating side opens up when charging and the button departs mine is now held together with rubberbands and is very hard to operate as the onoff button does not align with the switch sides of case material made too thin probably made that way to save weight they do still work when i can turn them on,393
"I bought this for a Raspberry Pi, and got it working as an Airplay receiver. It only draws 500mA so that's good, it can be powered by the RPi's USB bus. But, the sound is just ok / pretty thin and sounds worse as one ups the volume - I think one would probably be better off with an externally powered speaker over the audio jack at maybe  $20 price point rather than these.<br /><br />The button-based volume controls do nothing connected to the RPi, my guess is with other setups they simply would adjust the host's audio.",3.0,i bought this for a raspberry pi and got it working as an airplay receiver it only draws ma so thats good it can be powered by the rpis usb bus but the sound is just ok pretty thin and sounds worse as one ups the volume i think one would probably be better off with an externally powered speaker over the audio jack at maybe price point rather than thesebr br the buttonbased volume controls do nothing connected to the rpi my guess is with other setups they simply would adjust the hosts audio,494

"&lt;edit><br />It turns out it was working, but none of the games I tried would recognize it for some reason. I ended up using a program to make it press keyboard keys instead, and was able to use that for anything that didn't work.

"This is a pretty large device. The good news is that there’s quite a bit of room between the outlets so large plugs will fit easily.  I like that it comes in black or white. It has a nice long power cord that is convenient.  900 joules of surge protection is on the low side of surge protection but sufficient for my needs. What I dislike is quite a long list:<br />1. There is no UL listed markings on the device itself. So it’s unlikely it is UL listed. If the seller can provide the proper UL documentation I will gladly update this. The lack of markings from UL labs, means it’s likely we have been lied to. Doesn’t inspire confidence in an electrical device. Is it really a surge protector or just a power strip?<br />2. There is no manufacturer address, toll free number or company email address. It has an email address at outlook.com. Not valas.com or some parent company.<br />3. Strange looking warranty - see photo<br />4. Inattention to detail in the manual. There’s a typo on the manual (the piece of paper included in the box) that states it’s 300,000watts. - see photo.<br />5. Amazon listing has inconsistencies. For example, they state it has a flat plug at one point, yet show a normal plug on all the pictures. It does have a normal plug. They state it has a two year warranty on the Amazon listing, but the piece of paper in the box states one year.<br />6. I am not noticing the childproof covers they mention?<br />7. The 3rd (out of 7 photos you can scroll through at the top of the Amazon listing) shows 1300J joules of surge protection. The rest of the listing says 900 joules. Strange inaccuracies. Maybe they make a different surge protector that looks similar and used the wrong photo? Either that, or someone accidentally typed 1300 instead of 900?<br /><br />I don’t have a lot of confidence in this. I am using it, but will try to remember to unplug it before leaving the house.

"UPDATE: After using this thing for a year I am lowering my review from 5 stars to 3.<br />Although all the things I said in my initial review are still true. I realized that this laptop always defaults to the onboard graphics card that has lower specs than the dedicated. It has a GTX 960M, which is listed on the nvidia website as 4k capable. I tried to force it into 4k mode for a drawing tablet on photoshop, with a tablet monitor capable of 4k and it wouldn't do it. And because this is a mobile GPU card, there was no option to plug directly to the dedicated card to bypass the onboard card. Tried it with other things like games, and could not force it into 4k even when using nvidia control panel to specify which card you want a program to use.<br /><br />That was very disappointing as part of the appeal of buying this is the relatively powerful mobile graphics card. Not being able to use it fully due to the setup is lowering the value of this laptop.<br />__________________________________________________________________________________<br />This laptop is pretty beast. I had a ROG g75vw and while it was fine, it was much heavier than this laptop at about 9-10lbs. The old laptop also didn't fit in my backpack without a lot of cramming. This one is more powerful, and more compact, but beware, the battery life sucks if you're trying to use it for gaming. For regular internet surfing without a lot of background applications running, you can reasonably expect the battery to last 1-3 hours on a medium brightness setting. I use it as a desktop replacement, so it never becomes an issue for me.<br /><br />The other thing to note, the battery on this laptop is on the inside. It seems like with every new line Asus makes, they try more and more to replicate Macbooks with their sleek lines, gestures and tamper-proof components. I initially liked Asus because even in the laptops they would make the components accessible, easy to clean and easy to modify. Now even the battery can't be accessed without a screwdriver...<br />There's only 4 USB A ports on this laptop. There's space for one more, but the last USB port is a USB C port, which sort of a waste of a port for now, but will come in handy in the future when everyone converts to it.<br /><br />Besides that, the actual performance of the machine is great. If you get rid of all the bloatware, it is blazing fast and boots in only a few second if you have quick boot enabled in BIOS. I didn't like the windows 10 scheme, so I used start10 to fix the interface. After that it was perfect!<br /><br />tl;dr some flaws, but overall great for normal use, gaming and graphic design that needs heavy processing power (digital painting).",3.0,update after using this thing for a year i am lowering my review from stars to br although all the things i said in my initial review are still true i realized that this laptop always defaults to the onboard graphics card that has lower specs than the dedicated it has a gtx m which is listed on the nvidia website as k capable i tried to force it into k mode for a drawing tablet on photoshop with a tablet monitor capable of k and it wouldnt do it and because this is a mobile gpu card there was no option to plug directly to the dedicated card to bypass the onboard card tried it with other things like games and could not force it into k even when using nvidia control panel to specify which card you want a program to usebr br that was very disappointing as part of the appeal of buying this is the relatively powerful mobile graphics card not being able to use it fully due to the setup is lowering the value of this laptopbr __________________________________________________________________________________br this laptop is pretty beast i had a rog gvw and while it was fine it was much heavier than this laptop at about lbs the old laptop also didnt fit in my backpack without a lot of cramming this one is more powerful and more compact but beware the battery life sucks if youre trying to use it for gaming for regular internet surfing without a lot of background applications running you can reasonably expect the battery to last hours on a medium brightness setting i use it as a desktop replacement so it never becomes an issue for mebr br the other thing to note the battery on this laptop is on the inside it seems like with every new line asus makes they try more and more to replicate macbooks with their sleek lines gestures and tamperproof components i initially liked asus because even in the laptops they would make the components accessible easy to clean and easy to modify now even the battery cant be accessed without a screwdriverbr theres only usb a ports on this laptop theres space for one more but the last usb port is a usb c port which sort of a waste of a port for now but will come in handy in the future when everyone converts to itbr br besides that the actual performance of the machine is great if you get rid of all the bloatware it is blazing fast and boots in only a few second if you have quick boot enabled in bios i didnt like the windows scheme so i used start to fix the interface after that it was perfectbr br tldr some flaws but overall great for normal use gaming and graphic design that needs heavy processing power digital painting,2583

"This is the worst Harmony I've ever used.  It's an ergonomic disaster with little that is done right.  It is however still a Harmony, so it somehow salvages 3 stars for what they all do right.<br /><br />It seemed nice in the box, and it was a breeze transferring everything from my Harmony 700 to this via the My Harmony program.  The weight and balance are good and the charging cradle works well.  Everything else ranges from bad to worse.<br /><br />Maybe one day the screen/pad will do what I need it to do, but for now it's rubbish and it's in the location where the most used buttons should be.  As a result those buttons are below (4 way controller, volume, channel, etc... or above (play, pause, etc...).  Ugh!  Worse yet the screen/pad isn't just dead space (honestly it would be better if it were), rather it's live.  That can be ok when it's acting like a touch pad with various taps and swipes to do things (it never works that well, but I see what they're trying to do), but it's a disaster when it's live with functions that are so seldom used there's no dedicated button.  So channel favorites, random superfluous functions, etc get accidentally pressed.  Even then they hardly work in the case of the favorites with my Motorola cable box running Uverse (95% of the time 2 or 3 of the 4 digits are recognized).  When you avoid that pad the other buttons are cramped and arranged poorly even within their poor locations.  The 4 way pad is small, as are the play and pause buttons and the skip and fast forward buttons are shared.  Of all the sacrifices made for the screen/pad, those red, green, yellow, and blue buttons you never use are still there--UGH!!!!!<br /><br />Move the screen up, move the key buttons where the fingers land, kill the color keyed buttons that don't ever do s***, and try again.  Oh and the battery life sucks too.  Please make a new flagship controller ala the Harmony One (original) 880, etc...

"Let's start with the good:<br /><br />The design is great. Very minimal bezels, mostly metal body, and good looking (and sturdy) legs. The top 2/3 of the screen is very thin. Bottom 1/3 is thicker, but houses all the internals.<br /><br />The panel is great for a TV of this price. Not the brightest, but will do for most environments. Displays a wide color gamut and has low input lag in game mode<br /><br />The UI is good, not great. Android TV feels familiar if you use an Android phone and actually allows the TV to be setup using an Android device. Still some bugs with certain apps force closing.<br /><br />The sound is about as good as you can get in a TV. Due to the form factor you're obviously not going to be getting deep bass. Rather shallow sound. But that's TV speakers for you.<br /><br />Now the not so good:<br /><br />Frame bent: This isn't necessarily LeEco's fault, but about halfway across the top the frame was bent. Imagine the iphone bend problem...it looked like that. Luckily, it didn't seem to affect the panel itself. It was there from box opening. I 2 person lifted the TV properly, so it wasn't my handling that caused the damage.<br /><br />Light bleed: For some reason LeEco decided to light the entire screen from the bottom. On dark content you can definitely see a small strip of light bleed on the bottom edge.<br /><br />Clouding: Again, on dark scenes you can see some clouding of the blacks. It's hard not to notice once you spot it. Bright and/or colorful scenes don't suffer.<br /><br />So in summary, this TV is good, but not without flaws. I got it for under $700, which is a good price for what you're getting here. Panel differences could eliminate the clouding or light bleed issue, along with the bent frame.

"It's near impossible to tell if there's anything behind my jeep. I wanted to be able to see behind me and I also wanted a forward camera to be able to record trail rides. I went with this mirror dash cam. I didn't even know these things existed until recently.<br /><br />For recording, I'm using a samsung high endurance 64GB SD card. The  built in formatting function is simple and quick. The video feeds for front and rear cameras are pretty clear. Going from one view to the other or both takes a a swipe.<br /><br />I removed the OEM mirror and installed this as a full replacement. One thing about this mount vs the OEM, is that this one vibrates badly. Also, there's only one part that rotates behind the mirror. Whereas the OEM mirror rotates at the base and the mirror.<br /><br />I stuck the reverse camera in the middle of spare tire mount. There was more than enough enough wire to run along the cage length of my jeep wrangler unlimited. I did not hook up the wire for the reverse lines, but the camera is live without it. It connects through a slim single plug from rear camera to mirror.<br /><br />As for trying to use the rear camera full time instead of the mirror surface, there's still quite a bit of reflection. Even at full brightness. To cut down on the amount of reflection, you need to point the mirror at yourself instead of the towards the rear of the vehicle as you would do with a regular mirror. Which can be difficult since there's only that one pivot on this mirror.<br /><br />One thing that was necessary for me, was to get the latest firmware. Out of the box, there's no way to turn off the loud music that plays when the mirror powers on and off. It'd be nice to have actual volume control even with the firmware, there's only on and off. There's no way I could have kept this mirror without being able to turn that sound off.<br /><br />One other thing I'd like is a GPS module so I could overlay speed and even record trails overlays for off roading.

"This case comprises two shallow, hard plastic &#34;shells&#34; that snap very tightly onto the top and bottom of the Yoga 2 Pro. The fit is so tight that at first I was concerned the covers might be a bit too small, but it turned out they were exactly right. You have to be careful to apply pressure where the little retaining nubs are located -- squeezing the covers in between nubs won't afford enough pressure where it's needed and the plastic will just bend. There could also be some risk of applying too much force to the super-thin screen portion of the Yoga 2 Pro, so be careful. The injection-molded shells, however, proved to be very precisely made, and once snapped in place they fit perfectly.<br /><br />That said, I was disappointed to find that the covers are just a little too thick to permit the Yoga 2 Pro to fold all the way back into &#34;tablet&#34; mode. The thickness of two additional layers of plastic was just enough so that I imagine you could damage the hinges if you were to force the screen flat back against the bottom part of the laptop. This isn't a deal breaker, but it does rule out one of the appealing &#34;asana positions&#34; of the Yoga 2 Pro.<br /><br />This kind of case isn't intended to cover the entire computer, so don't be surprised that the vents and edges of the Yoga 2 Pro are still exposed to the world. If you're using the computer mainly as a laptop, or in the other &#34;positions&#34; (lying flat open, or in tent or backwards position), the shell case doesn't interfere at all -- only the fully folded-back tablet position is disallowed.<br /><br />I will probably use this case now and then, after I've had more time to determine how important tablet position really is.

"I mainly ordered this product so I can have some contrast in colors with the pen.  When placing the pen on top of, let's say, white blankets or bed sheets, it's actually difficult to find.  This product took care of that issue.  The cons: the Apple Pencil is designed to stick on and charge through the side of the iPad.  This product, although you can get it to stick and charge on the iPad, the product somehow weakens the magnetic connection by putting a little more depth and no direct contact between the pen and the iPad which causes the pen to fall off the iPad a lot easier.  Now, I do not recommend anyone to travel and transport the pen on the side of the iPad, this product does make it a whole lot more unsafe to do so (greater risk of losing your pen).  As far as the grip of the pen, I guess it's a little better, but for that feature, it is definitely not a ""night and day"" difference.  My feelings on this product is neutral.

"My wife bought me a Squeezebox for Xmas 2011. It was the only item on my list because, what can you actually get for the guy who has everything?  This is a sleek design and it has a very nice look on any shelf. The sound quality is excellent given the size and you can even crank up the volume if you like. It has 6 stations you can preset so that you don't have to keep searching for the stations you like.<br /><br />My two daughters speak fluent french because of an early education French immersion program, so I thought it would be fun to listen to the Paris, France' version of National Public Radio. No problem tuning it in although it does seem to take a few more steps than necessary.  Logitech could do a little more work on their user interface to make it a tad more user friendly.<br /><br />A nice feature is that you don't have to turn on the power button to get a preset station as it is programmed to just come on when you press your preset. A small thing but with all the buttons we need to press these days I like the fact that they designed this one less button to push feature.<br /><br />When first set up on my wireless network it found it straight away. Input my password, and I set up on the wireless and away you go.....for the first time that is! Logitech did not design the radio with a two way wireless receiver, which means it will find a port on your router to start, but if your network goes down and ask the Squeezebox to establish a new IP address, NO LOVE!<br /><br />At first I thought I had a defective unit, not really knowing what they designed into the circuitry. I have worked in the high tech industry for years and have a cursory knowledged of how an IP enabled device would get its' connection.  I called tech support at Logitech.  BE PREPARED to wait for a long time to get someone on the line.<br /><br />Below is the instructions I received via email from Logitech:<br /><br />To allow the squeezebox proper access to your home network please open the following ports.<br /><br />Port number: 3483 (TCP) - Name: Server Control<br /><br />Port number: 3483 (UDP) - Name: ServerDiscovery<br /><br />Port number: 9000 (TCP) - Name: Server Web<br /><br />Port number: 9090 (TCP) - Name: Server MySQL<br /><br />Port Number: 9092 (TCP) - Name: Server MySQL<br /><br />Basically I have to figure out how to block these ports so that only the Squeezebox gets access to them. Kind of a pain in the tookus, but there you have it.  If it weren't for this flaw, I would give it 5 stars. For now it will run on ethernet.

"I haven't had this device for long, but so far I think I agree with most of the positive reviews here. One thing I have not seen mentioned, however, is that there seems to be no way to have the player adjust the image of anamorphic DVD sources such that the picture fills the screen as much as possible.<br /><br />If you've got a 16:9 TV, then you're familiar with the various ""stretch"" viewing modes, and how with many sources the image must be ""stretched"" in the vertical direction in order for it to fill the screen and (more importantly) for the image to be rendered at the right aspect ratio. In other words, if the movie has a shot of a basketball, the basketball should look like a basketball, not a blunt football.<br /><br />With this player, the only means I've found to get the aspect ratio right for anamorphic disks is to tell it to use the 4:3 TV setting. That corrects the aspect ratio problem, but it leaves about half the screen unused - that half-screen is more-or-less what I wanted when I paid extra for this thing!<br /><br />Anamorphic DVDs are not rare, by any means! As I was picking DVDs from my shelf to test the player, I found that the first 5 I picked were anamorphic. It's something I generally don't think about at all, because all my other playback mechanisms are capable of dealing with that format.

"In May of 2011, my husband and I had sold our house preparing to move into a sweet condo in the city.  We'd made a decent profit off the sale, which we were reinvesting into top-of-the-line furniture, kitchen equipment, etc.  I don't remember how we made it into Best Buy, but we did.  He was wandering around while I was browsing myself.  I found myself hovering over the Beats by Dr. Dre display, more out of curiosity than anything else, when the husband appeared beside me.<br /><br />""Do you like those headphones?""<br /><br />""Huh?""<br /><br />""I know that you like to listen to your music on your laptop.  Do you want a pair of these?""<br /><br />""Honey, these are freaking THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS.""<br /><br />""We've got the money.  Do you want them?""<br /><br />I looked at myself with the headphones on.  Black and sleek with red accents; I looked vaguely cool.  And I said ""sure, why not?""<br /><br />And so a pair of Beats Studio came home with me.<br /><br />Flash forward to almost two years later.  I have the Beats on my head as I type.  They're comfortable.  I'm a child of the seventies and remember the ""cans"" that were headphones then and these feel very familiar.  They pick up nice licks and beats and overall I enjoy them.  But ...<br /><br />Yeah, there's ""buts"".<br /><br />First, these don't work without batteries.<br /><br />First (A), these things eat batteries like crazy.  Get rechargeable AAAs or prepare to keep Duracell or Energizer in business.  I generally have to replace batteries about once every couple of weeks and I only have them on a couple of hours a day.<br /><br />Second, these are HARD on their wires.  When you buy there will be two cords, one regular and one with a microphone so you can use them to talk on your cell phone (which is meh at best).  For some reason the wire bends at the connection to the phones and completely shreds it.  And I'm careful too.  Fortunately cheap replacement cords can be found on eBay, but still.<br /><br />Third--these are bulky with their case and if, like me, you're a light traveler they're a pain to bring along.  The noise-cancelling thing is another meh.  I had a pair of Sennheisers that were somewhat unwieldy as well but did way better in cancelling noise than these.<br /><br />For what I use them for--listening to stuff on my laptop at home--Studio Beats do the job.

"I ended up replacing this keyboard because it got so frustrating waiting for it to communicate properly with my PC. It would start to double keystrokes and miss keystrokes at the same time, and then it would just freeze and do nothing for 2, minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, even an hour or more. Restarting seemed to do nothing. Eventually it would start to work again, but then after a while it would start doing the same thing, missing keystrokes, doubling them up, and then, sure enough, it would freeze up again.

"Mainly got these for playing CS GO which they turn out to be very good for. The semi open back design is working well for telling where footstep and other telling sounds are coming from. Definitely an improvement in that regard. However, I was also hoping that they would be nice for music. And I can't really say that I'm impressed at all there. They sound like about what you would expect for $30 headphones. I don't see an issue on the bass end like many people complained about, but the tinny high end is real. Overall just kind of weak and uninspiring. Now that said, my computer doesn't really seem to push them enough. Have to crank the volume all the way up, over twice as far as my old headphones. And more than twice as high as my speakers. So I ordered a DAC/AMP for them. Kind of defeats the purpose of saving money on cheaper headphones. :) But I really want them to be dual purpose.

"First off, I would like to state clearly that I did return these items. Even so, there are likely people who would be okay with these headphones, so here's my take so you know what to expect.<br /><br />I've used 3 different sets of bone-conduction/induction headphones so far. Since I had such a great experience with my first pair (which were relatively cheap) I decided I was more than happy to drop more money on the next step up, which was these guys.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, they sounded exactly like the cheaper pair (which was a bit of a disappointment). So if you're deeply concerned about the sound quality, I would recommend trying out the cheaper ones first.<br /><br />Even with the quality being as it was, that was not my reason for returning them. Instead, you'll notice the large control/battery compartment behind the right ear. While other wraparound headphones are designed in a similar way, I found this compartment to be larger than normal, and much too close to my ear. This resulted in the headphones constantly chaffing against the back of my ear which therefore made them unwearable. It's possible that I just have larger ears than other people, or a particular shape to my head that causes them to sit like that, but regardless this may also be the case for you, so be forewarned.",3.0,first off i would like to state clearly that i did return these items even so there are likely people who would be okay with these headphones so heres my take so you know what to expectbr br ive used different sets of boneconductioninduction headphones so far since i had such a great experience with my first pair which were relatively cheap i decided i was more than happy to drop more money on the next step up which was these guysbr br in terms of sound quality they sounded exactly like the cheaper pair which was a bit of a disappointment so if youre deeply concerned about the sound quality i would recommend trying out the cheaper ones firstbr br even with the quality being as it was that was not my reason for returning them instead youll notice the large controlbattery compartment behind the right ear while other wraparound headphones are designed in a similar way i found this compartment to be larger than normal and much too close to my ear this resulted in the headphones constantly chaffing against the back of my ear which therefore made them unwearable its possible that i just have larger ears than other people or a particular shape to my head that causes them to sit like that but regardless this may also be the case for you so be forewarned,1265

If you are going from a low budget 24"" TN 60hz monitor your mom bought you for Christmas five years ago, then yeah, it's going to feel like an upgrade. If you really compared it in person to other higher quality monitors, you'd feel like a turd realizing you spent $300+ on this thing.<br />This monitor and its Samsung VA panel color and brightness kinda suck compared to my Dell IPS this replaced also appears no better than a Dell TN I had either. I ran through the Windows monitor calibration and the brightness is at 100, this Amazon white background on the screen looks dark enough to almost be a very light gray to give you an idea. Just super dim. There are no dead pixels luckily. The buttons are awful and the OSD is clunky. The thing is so cheap and flimsy it feels like you're going to break it while pushing the buttons to get it configured.<br />I wanted to upgrade to 1440p on a budget, but not like this. The stand sucks it’s really wide so it wouldn't fit on my monitor stand and has no height adjustment, so had to buy a VESA mount basically increased the cost by a additional $30. If this monitor is typical for Viotek, I'd say it's worth it to spend a little more and get a better quality monitor.",3.0,i dont believe all these five star reviews it looks like people have no clue as to what a good display is if you are going from a low budget tn hz monitor your mom bought you for christmas five years ago then yeah its going to feel like an upgrade if you really compared it in person to other higher quality monitors youd feel like a turd realizing you spent on this thingbr this monitor and its samsung va panel color and brightness kinda suck compared to my dell ips this replaced also appears no better than a dell tn i had either i ran through the windows monitor calibration and the brightness is at this amazon white background on the screen looks dark enough to almost be a very light gray to give you an idea just super dim there are no dead pixels luckily the buttons are awful and the osd is clunky the thing is so cheap and flimsy it feels like youre going to break it while pushing the buttons to get it configuredbr i wanted to upgrade to p on a budget but not like this the stand sucks its really wide so it wouldnt fit on my monitor stand and has no height adjustment so had to buy a vesa mount basically increased the cost by a additional if this monitor is typical for viotek id say its worth it to spend a little more and get a better quality monitor,1268

"I have owned and loved Etymōtic earphones for many years. For awhile they discontinued replaceable cables. They returned to replaceable cable this time with a proprietary version of the MMCX plug. This plug incorporates a locking clip to secure the ear phone which prevents you from using any of the large selection of MMCX cables. There are expensive Audiophile grade cables. The Etymōtic cable is fragile, the strain relief elbows on the MMCX terminations  always break, always. Just using them to place and remove the earphones is enough the eventually break them.

"I ordered this wristband in November to replace one I'd had for several years. The first thing I noticed is that the rose gold is truly pink.

But again, it wasn't expensive and I don't mind that too much either. By FAR, my biggest complaint is that the edges of this band catch and snag on my shirts ALL the time. There is constantly fuzz on the edges of the band from my clothes, and I have to carefully ""unsnag"" the band constantly so that it doesn't cause holes. My last band did not do this.

It also paired easily with my iPod and MacBook Air.  The &#34;dancing light&#34; display is not as good as some that I have seen, but, the price of this one is lots lower than the others I have seen.

"After reading a lot of raving reviews for this bag I decided to give it a try when it was time to replace my old one. The bag and I have been in a love-hate relationship ever since. There are a lot of features to like about it. The material is excellent. The handle is very comfortable. It doesn't sag. Tons of space. Very secure placement of your laptop in the center of the bag. Very useful outside pockets and a great three-part zippered compartment. Somehow it feels much lighter and smaller than it is.<br /><br />On the other hand, the need to open and close buckles everytime you want to access your laptop is maddening. Yes, there are oodles of pockets, but many of them are ""ribbon""-style (open at top and bottom), which makes them only useful for large items. What really ticks me off is that there is no easily accessible place for pens. The loop on the back to put the bag on top of a roll-on bag is so flimsy my bag has slipped off a few times.<br /><br />So while there's a lot of things I really like about this bag, I am not sure I can wholeheartedly recommend it.

"I have several Vizio items in my home, so I thought to give this a try when I wanted to upgrade to 802.11N. I find it very easy to set up with the basics, but not intuitive with regard to the more advanced features. Nonetheless, we had it set up and running in short order. The problem that plagued us was that we could not keep a connection. We tried many creative approaches to the problem. My earlier Motorola worked fine for several years, and was easy to set up. I gave serious thought to buying a different brand; I declined to send it back because of other reports of poor support. But reviews of different brands of routers in this class were all lacklustre. Many, it seems, are having the same problem that we were. Erratic behavior and constant dropping of signals, with no outwardly visible reason.<br /><br />We hit at last on having a small (3"" | 8cm) fan blowing on the router, even though it didn't seem very warm, much less hot. That seems to have done the trick. We have run in our ""standard"" arrangement for several weeks with no drops and plenty of bandwidth to each device. We have Ooma and a laptop plugged in (Cat 5), 3 laptops running wireless N cards, and 2 iTouches. The iTouches connect @ 2.4 GHz, the rest @ 5 GHz.<br /><br />I'll contact Vizio with my observations and see what happens, but for now we seem to be running just fine.

"I got 2 of these for my pre-teen twins.  The kick-stand broke off on the one of them pretty fast.

So far most of the games my kids play work fine, although my HTC Evo 3D phone blows this tablet out of the water in terms of performance.<br /><br />I would not trust those glowing reviews and suggest that we all understand that usually u get what you pay for.  That being said, in terms of value - this is probably the best tablet on the market.<br /><br />Some additional thoughts:<br />1.  This tablet is very easy to hold given its wider bezel which is much more convenient than some of the tablets where the screen takes almost the entire face of the tablet.<br /><br />2.  on/off and volume buttons are sticking out a little, so they get pressed accidentally quite a lot when playing games.<br /><br />3.

"I've owned a lot of &#34;high-end&#34; logitech mice like the mx700 and the mx1000.  Both were great mice.  They had drawbacks, but I always felt they were well thought out.<br /><br />I had high expectations for the Performance Mx, but I'm disappointed with it.<br /><br />First the good:<br />The mouse tracks well and delivers on its DarkField technology promise.  I also really like the button on the scroll wheel that allows you to control the scroll rate (if it's clicked in the wheel functions like a regular scroll wheel, if released, the wheel has a lot less resistance letting you move through documents quickly).  The task button is handy, but I hardly use it.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />What I don't get about the mouse is the location of the forward and back buttons.  I have large hands and have never struggled with being able to reach buttons on a mouse, but I do on the performance mx.  The buttons are located near the top.  And, while you can reach the back button easily, the forward button is very cumbersome to operate.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever used the zoom button for zooming. I just reprogrammed to go back and used the back button to go forward.  It's nice that I can do that, but it's annoying to have a button I can't use on the device (I.e. the forward button).<br /><br />All in all:<br />It's a decent mouse that looks great, but the ergonomics need to be rethought.",3.0,ive owned a lot of highend logitech mice like the mx and the mx both were great mice they had drawbacks but i always felt they were well thought outbr br i had high expectations for the performance mx but im disappointed with itbr br first the goodbr the mouse tracks well and delivers on its darkfield technology promise i also really like the button on the scroll wheel that allows you to control the scroll rate if its clicked in the wheel functions like a regular scroll wheel if released the wheel has a lot less resistance letting you move through documents quickly the task button is handy but i hardly use itbr br the badbr what i dont get about the mouse is the location of the forward and back buttons i have large hands and have never struggled with being able to reach buttons on a mouse but i do on the performance mx the buttons are located near the top and while you can reach the back button easily the forward button is very cumbersome to operatebr br i dont think ive ever used the zoom button for zooming i just reprogrammed to go back and used the back button to go forward its nice that i can do that but its annoying to have a button i cant use on the device ie the forward buttonbr br all in allbr its a decent mouse that looks great but the ergonomics need to be rethought,1296

"I really love the convenience of this table, but I’ve had some issues crop up since I purchased it. The main issue is that the small side tray started to lose its ability to stay at the position where I originally adjusted it. So now, rather than being a flat side table that can be used, it tilts to the back, which is frustrating. I have to put a heavier item on the front side in order for it to sit flat, and if it gets bumped, or when I roll it, things tend fall off again as it reverts to the tilted position. This makes it kind of a pain to move, which is kind of the purpose of having it, since it’s a rolling table.<br /><br />I do like the concept itself, I have just had some problems with the sturdiness and quality which have been disappointing.",3.0,i really love the convenience of this table but ive had some issues crop up since i purchased it the main issue is that the small side tray started to lose its ability to stay at the position where i originally adjusted it so now rather than being a flat side table that can be used it tilts to the back which is frustrating i have to put a heavier item on the front side in order for it to sit flat and if it gets bumped or when i roll it things tend fall off again as it reverts to the tilted position this makes it kind of a pain to move which is kind of the purpose of having it since its a rolling tablebr br i do like the concept itself i have just had some problems with the sturdiness and quality which have been disappointing,734

"This is not a bad product, but in this particular case I just cannot get past the price.  For 1/4 the price, you could have a standard commercial style rack mount 24 port patch panel, and get mounting brackets for another $10.  For the price of this and the recommended enclosure, you could have the above noted commercial style panel with a small cabinet.<br /><br />I thought that perhaps this came with 24 individual ports that lock into place, which would be easier to wire and explain the extra cost, but it is just your standard 110 punch down on the back.  And it comes with a plastic punch down tool:  might as well just use a screwdriver.  If you're spending $200 for a patch panel, the least you can do is spend another $10 on a cheap punch down tool.<br /><br />The nice thing is this can be mounted on plywood if you don't have the home enclosure system.

"This is my first exposure to Panasonic Active Noise Canceling (ANC) headphones. This particular model is very inexpensive relative to most ANC phones on the market, and unfortunately the low price is justified. These phones fall short in a couple of important areas.<br /><br />First and foremost, these are ANC phones and the ANC function does indeed work. That said, the degree to which it works is in line with the pricing. I have a very specific fan in the house that I use as a benchmark, as most ANC phones are able to nearly completely wipe out the white noise that this fan generates when on the lowest speed setting. The Panasonic phones kill a good bit of the fan noise but allow more noise than almost every other ANC set I have tried. In the office I tried these phones in an area serviced by two large air handlers that generate a lot of noise and these headphones did remarkably well though still not as well as most other phones I have tried in the same environment. Now, when compared to the likes of Bose, Panasonic does a very poor job but then again they cost maybe 15% of what Bose costs. When considering this price differential the Panasonic phones do a decent job with their ANC which should be acceptable by most for traveling.<br /><br />One area where these phones fail, though, is in build quality. These headphones are extremely lightweight and they feel very flimsy and fragile. These are not the headphones to take when traveling frequently. To add insult to injury, they come with a cloth carry bag which offers absolutely no protection at all beyond serving as a dust cover.<br /><br />Worse, though, is the miserable sound quality. I don't know if my specific headset is the problem but while I have a decent full range of sound, everything across the spectrum sounds slightly tinny and hollow. I was encouraged that Panasonic does not overdrive the bass as many manufacturers tend to do and instead delivers a fairly balanced spectrum, but this does not make up for the poor quality of sound. As these are inexpensive headphones I would never expect them to be audiophile quality, but the sound should absolutely be much better than it is.<br /><br />I was encouraged to see that Panasonic includes a 2-prong adapter in the package, but then they omit the 1/4&#34; adapter which is something I actually use.<br /><br />Panasonic has made a very inexpensive ANC headphone and unfortunately the low cost is justified. While the ANC capabilities are within reason for the price range, the sound quality and build quality are severely lacking. If looking for ANC phones for the purpose of using the ANC function, and keeping costs low is important, then these phones may fill that need acceptably. However, if sound quality is in any way important, these are the wrong phones and will sorely disappoint.",3.0,this is my first exposure to panasonic active noise canceling anc headphones this particular model is very inexpensive relative to most anc phones on the market and unfortunately the low price is justified these phones fall short in a couple of important areasbr br first and foremost these are anc phones and the anc function does indeed work that said the degree to which it works is in line with the pricing i have a very specific fan in the house that i use as a benchmark as most anc phones are able to nearly completely wipe out the white noise that this fan generates when on the lowest speed setting the panasonic phones kill a good bit of the fan noise but allow more noise than almost every other anc set i have tried in the office i tried these phones in an area serviced by two large air handlers that generate a lot of noise and these headphones did remarkably well though still not as well as most other phones i have tried in the same environment now when compared to the likes of bose panasonic does a very poor job but then again they cost maybe of what bose costs when considering this price differential the panasonic phones do a decent job with their anc which should be acceptable by most for travelingbr br one area where these phones fail though is in build quality these headphones are extremely lightweight and they feel very flimsy and fragile these are not the headphones to take when traveling frequently to add insult to injury they come with a cloth carry bag which offers absolutely no protection at all beyond serving as a dust coverbr br worse though is the miserable sound quality i dont know if my specific headset is the problem but while i have a decent full range of sound everything across the spectrum sounds slightly tinny and hollow i was encouraged that panasonic does not overdrive the bass as many manufacturers tend to do and instead delivers a fairly balanced spectrum but this does not make up for the poor quality of sound as these are inexpensive headphones i would never expect them to be audiophile quality but the sound should absolutely be much better than it isbr br i was encouraged to see that panasonic includes a prong adapter in the package but then they omit the adapter which is something i actually usebr br panasonic has made a very inexpensive anc headphone and unfortunately the low cost is justified while the anc capabilities are within reason for the price range the sound quality and build quality are severely lacking if looking for anc phones for the purpose of using the anc function and keeping costs low is important then these phones may fill that need acceptably however if sound quality is in any way important these are the wrong phones and will sorely disappoint,2742

"I have a [[ASIN:B00SMBG8QY VIZIO SB3821-C6 38-Inch 2.1 Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer]] but wanted to add rear speakers and a better display.

And they're about the same price.

Much more usable.  But it's also got sound matching the smaller size - it's comparatively tinny sounding and less full.  Those are two different things.  Tinny perhaps because it's so much smaller.  But it also doesn't fill the space as well, perhaps because there are so many fewer drivers.  The Vizio has three driver-sets in the sound-bar, including for the center.

"This is an excellent lens.  We bought it because my husband enjoys action photography and I enjoy wildlife photography.  The lens quality is excellent and the zoom is very handy, however there are some disadvantages.  This lens  is very large and requires a sturdy tripod, hence the tripod mount built into the lens.  The bellows function that allows the zoom tends to blow dust into the sensor, increasing the maintenance required on any camera used with this lens.  When used with a doubler, this lens can only be focused manually.  Also, this is an f4.5-5.6 lens, which is adequate for bright light, but frustrating in many situations when you're used to f2.8 or better.",3.0,this is an excellent lens we bought it because my husband enjoys action photography and i enjoy wildlife photography the lens quality is excellent and the zoom is very handy however there are some disadvantages this lens is very large and requires a sturdy tripod hence the tripod mount built into the lens the bellows function that allows the zoom tends to blow dust into the sensor increasing the maintenance required on any camera used with this lens when used with a doubler this lens can only be focused manually also this is an f lens which is adequate for bright light but frustrating in many situations when youre used to f or better,641

"Other comments are generally spot on....<br /><br />I would only add that the price of HDMI switchs has dropped so low that most folks might best consider one instead of a spitter.  Avoids the issues with signal loss and HDCP<br /><br />Especially recommend consider the 4x1 and 4x2 switches.  On the other side, if you have not yet upgraded to a HDMI based A/V receiver for your home theatre... they basically have an HDMI switch built in and aren't really expensive.

"[[VIDEOID:e35199fa1b0082164368256930222290]] This simple, basic, budget-friendly teleprompter works fine for the price and is relatively easy to use. Any complexity in using this comes from the free app, which lets you add (copy paste from elsewhere) and edit text into 7 color options, a range of font sizes, and several speeds.<br />The stand works fine, but it’s extremely short, so you need a desk or something else to bring it to eye level (not a stand-alone item), but you can attach it to your own tripod as well (which I did in my pic—TRIPOD IN PIC IS NOT INCLUDED). I took a short clip of the Teleprompter in action, as well as a collage of a few photos so you can see how the interface works and how the text looks in daylight.<br />Note: the remote did not work with any of my iPhones, so if that’s what you’re using, prepare to be disappointed with the absence of that feature. That’s a pretty serious issue, because it means you have to split your shoot into several takes to make any adjustments, rather than smoothly being able to do it in one shot.<br />I hope you find this review helpful!

"I thought I'd lost the charger that came with my FitBit and I can always use another wrist band so this seemed like a good deal. No where did it say that these were not Original FitBit parts but because of the price I assumed that they were NOT.  Both pieces arrived quickly and looked just like the original FitBit parts that I had. However it quickly became apparent that the charger was not an original.  My FitBit fits in the charger just fine but it does not hold in the correct position, so it does not charge.  I can't complain too much as the price was less than half of what I would have paid had I bought a replacement directly from FitBit (plus I got the  wristband too) and once I figured out the problem and came up with an easy solution it hasn't been a problem. It took me a while to figure out the problem because when I first put the fitbit into the charger it lights up but  but then it slowly pulls away from the connector pins inside the charger and then the lights go out. If you aren't watching for it you won't notice till hours later when you think it is fully charged and it isn't.  Now I just use a bit of scotch tape to hold the fitbit in the charger so that the connectors pins all stay in contact and problem is solved. I found my old charger so now I keep this one at my office where I have a tape dispenser handy and my original at home so I can charge my FitBit whenever it needs it.",3.0,i thought id lost the charger that came with my fitbit and i can always use another wrist band so this seemed like a good deal no where did it say that these were not original fitbit parts but because of the price i assumed that they were not both pieces arrived quickly and looked just like the original fitbit parts that i had however it quickly became apparent that the charger was not an original my fitbit fits in the charger just fine but it does not hold in the correct position so it does not charge i cant complain too much as the price was less than half of what i would have paid had i bought a replacement directly from fitbit plus i got the wristband too and once i figured out the problem and came up with an easy solution it hasnt been a problem it took me a while to figure out the problem because when i first put the fitbit into the charger it lights up but but then it slowly pulls away from the connector pins inside the charger and then the lights go out if you arent watching for it you wont notice till hours later when you think it is fully charged and it isnt now i just use a bit of scotch tape to hold the fitbit in the charger so that the connectors pins all stay in contact and problem is solved i found my old charger so now i keep this one at my office where i have a tape dispenser handy and my original at home so i can charge my fitbit whenever it needs it,1390

"As the bow was drawn against the strings of the Cello, by Yo-Yo Ma, the magnificently gorgeous sounding notes were released and lifted into the air.  The tone, so pure, so correct, almost made me cry.  It was as if I could hear the sound created by each individual hair of the bow.<br /><br />The sound of Chris Botti's Trumpet,  each inflection and nuance of breath, created a drama and a stirring of emotion.  I could hear for the very first time not only the sound of each note, but also how the note was created.  As the finger valves danced up and down it was as if they were in slow motion, I could hear all of the elements that make up a note, a tone, so perfect.<br /><br />Every singers voice was now real.  I now know what their true voices sound like, no coloration, nothing over-emphasized, only a perfect presentation of their tone.  These speakers in my environment do not add any excessive warmth to sound.  And they do not add an excessive brightness to the sound.  Vocal tonal character is nothing but pure joy.<br /><br />The sound can be Big, Very Big.  All you have to do is turn them up.  If you have a room that's 12 x 24 with 9' foot ceilings, these things will fill the room easily.<br /><br />Based on the above, these speakers, the Elac Uni-fi 2.0, are worth every penny of their full retail price, $600.<br /><br />Unfortunately though I sent them back, for two reasons. 1.) It was difficult to hear the snare drum or the sound of the cymbals, or the shish-shish of the high hat.  I couldn't quite make out the xylophone, or the tympany.  2.)  For me, I just wasn't getting the dynamics I wanted.  Imagine if you have two 15"" speakers and two Public Address Bull Horns surrounding you.  When the symphony plays, you feel it!  You feel it in your heart and soul.  The Uni-fi 2.0 didn't do that for me.  But to be fair nothing with a 5.25 speaker has done it for me either.<br /><br />I'm conflicted, I love the sound of the Elac Unifi 2.0 so much, I really want it to work for me.  I'm considering buying the towers at twice the cost, and a new/used amp with 200 - 300 watts per channel.  I don't know if the extra watts, and extra woofers will create the dynamics, or if I'll be able to boost the treble enough to make these my forever speakers.<br /><br />My system: Two subwoofers, 12 cf enclosures, loaded with dual 12 inch woofers.  The subs are powered by a Behringer iNuke 3000, 440 watts per sub.  My speakers are powered by a Denon 1911 avr, 90 watts/ch@8ohms.  My speakers are L/C/R, Monoprice 15"" Passive PA speakers with 1.75 compression horns, 8 ohm, 96db efficient.

"One of the things that appealed to me about this backpack is the line in the description:<br />""Can accommodate 5-7 days travel items.""<br />I really take exception to that. If I had nothing but Speedo's and flipflops (and NOBODY wants that on any vacation), I might be able to pack 5 days of stuff.  This is not something that you could do without some practice.

"I bought this to see if my home made battery system would work. I have taken 8 cells of 18650@ 3500mAh in series to give 28,000 mAh of current at 3.7 volts. Everything this protected as a professional pack would be. I soldered the ends of the pack to the appropriate sides of this device. I have many power hungry battery powered projects and the pin layout for this hat seemed good. Size is decent. I’m most disappointed it only came with MicroPython code. I know that’s the dominant language because it requires the least knowledge and lines of code to build something. I don’t use MP. I only code in c/c++ using the Pico SDk only. I would raise my star rating if you included sample c code (not Arduino), pure c. Something with visual studio code for example.<br /><br />I can read the python code and see what it’s doing and code it myself but it would be cool if you just provided code for all the variants the pico supports. There are plenty of us c/c++ coders that like to be in full control of the MCU vs Micropython’s “here I’ll do everything for you just type a few lines”. Not everyone writes in a way where they want to be spoon fed everything. MP is great and I have nothing against it but don’t assume that’s the only language. Anyways enough ranting that no cares about. So far it’s doing its job keeping my power hungry projects running for a long time due to my battery packs. Will buy more and even give it a higher rating if Geekworm takes the time to read this (ha! Yeah right) and actually included example code for all supported languages. It’s not like it’s a hard thing to code. Oh well. I’ll probably just reverse engineer this product and make my own version.

"Do not buy this.  I bought this in November for my son for Christmas.  He used it exactly an hour before going back to other things. I shut it down, then stuck it on a shelf.  Fast forward to March.  He wants to use it again. So I boot it up for the awesomely long process of installing Windows updates - only there's a problem... the WiFi doesn't work.  &#34;No problem, it's probably a driver that needs updating&#34;, I think. Nope. When I try to do any troubleshooting, not only does the laptop refuse to believe there's a problem, it also refuses to believe it has WiFi hardware installed at all.  I had to reboot to even get it to recognize the hardware again. Then, as soon as anything needs to use the WiFi? Boom! Gone again.  Frustrated, I did a wipe and reset to factory. Same problems.  Only now, I don't get Windows 10 anymore because Microsoft decided to start charging for it.  But that's moot anyway, as I can't connect to the frigging net.  Now I have to fight these guys to get any service done; and of course they don't have service on the weekends.

"Okay, I bought this item a while ago and was able to use it in various ways.  Two main purposes I use this for is to workout and when I ride my Harley Davidson.  It has an okay sound, not as high as I thought it would.  Using my Harley, being that it's loud, it doesn't have that full bass full volume sound.  But what really effects both my working out and my riding is the fact that the cord is not long enough.  I'm not a little guy.  I've been a gym rat for a long while so my neck is very thick.  My dress shirts are 18.5 (collar size).  And this is where my main issue lays with these headphones.  It becomes a bit tight and the cord moves either to the left or to the right a bit too much and it gets tight.  Also, when I take them off and place the magnetic part in front of me it is a bit tight and if I turn my head the come apart.  I've found that it's more comfortable to use them with the cord in front of me as appose to behind my head/neck.  But then I risk losing them easier.  As far as water resistant, they seem to be okay.  Obviously in the gym and riding my bike when it rains (few times cause I don't like riding when it rains).",3.0,okay i bought this item a while ago and was able to use it in various ways two main purposes i use this for is to workout and when i ride my harley davidson it has an okay sound not as high as i thought it would using my harley being that its loud it doesnt have that full bass full volume sound but what really effects both my working out and my riding is the fact that the cord is not long enough im not a little guy ive been a gym rat for a long while so my neck is very thick my dress shirts are collar size and this is where my main issue lays with these headphones it becomes a bit tight and the cord moves either to the left or to the right a bit too much and it gets tight also when i take them off and place the magnetic part in front of me it is a bit tight and if i turn my head the come apart ive found that its more comfortable to use them with the cord in front of me as appose to behind my headneck but then i risk losing them easier as far as water resistant they seem to be okay obviously in the gym and riding my bike when it rains few times cause i dont like riding when it rains,1098

"&#34;Very good&#34; but not perfect. One of the Kindle's big selling point is the e-paper screen. This has one, but because Amazon uses it to monetize / put ads there, you can't actually use it for reading. Reading means turning it on and activating the backlight. It feels like a technical misstep: I never look at the screen when I'm NOT reading, so those ads are useless anyway. And it sacrifices one of the big selling points.<br /><br />Also, although it's a great reader, it's surprising to see it's still so slow like earlier versions. Browsing titles and using menus is clumsy.<br /><br />Once you start reading it's great. It just feels like two easy wins that were missed. A little disappointing.

"Since 2010, every time I’ve bought a new laptop, I’ve bought a new wireless mouse. I don’t like using the one on the laptop as it is too awkward and clunky for me.<br /><br />The mice I prefer – Logitech. The most recent one I got was: Logitech M317 – Amazon code B08L8SRJRR; white with purple/pink side grip, flowers on top. Though I did get it from Staples (the branding is shortened to Logi).<br /><br />To me, the brand doesn’t matter – I do try to keep my equipment the same, but the Logitech ones have never let me down. They’re also better shaped for my hand, though the ones of the last decade are smaller, which I LOVE. Last year when I got a new laptop for my birthday, I got the new little Logi listed above.<br /><br />I saw another HP mouse on here, the HP 930 Creator, and though that would be awesome. It wasn’t. I was quite disappointed. Not that I didn’t like my Logi, I though the HP would be a bit better. And, the 930 was over $67. Many problems, but the main one – size. Far too big for me in height and width.<br /><br />I saw this and thought it might be better than the 930 – was certainly simpler. I love the FLAT design. It’s about half the height of my Logi.<br /><br />This, like the 930 has a width problem, thus small hands and those with dexterity issues will have some problems “getting a grip”.<br /><br />Another issue with this – you need BLUETOOTH capabilities.<br /><br />Function?<br /><br />Connection: After turning on my computer’s BLUETOOTH, the mouse connected in under 5 minutes<br /><br />Sound: A bit quieter than my Logi, as well as the 930 Creator<br /><br />Scroll: A bit slower than the Logi, definitely slower than the 930<br /><br />Battery Replacement: Logi – on the bottom, like usual; 930 (rechargeable through USB). This? The battery is on the TOP. You have to remove the top black plate to put the battery in. This is the feature I dislike the most considering how THIN the plastic piece is. Depending on the amount of force used – it could easily get broken.<br /><br />Currently priced at $39.76, this is definitely a bit overpriced. I am not fond of it, and definitely wouldn’t get a replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of 3/26, the mouse keeps losing Bluetooth connectivity sometimes in as little as 15 minutes of non-use.

"These are the best sounding ear buds I have tried so far and are certainly affordable.  There is no hiss when the noise canceling is on, as there often is in other models.  The audio is clear in all ranges and neither too bright nor too muddy.<br /><br />These come with silicone and memory foam tips - I don't find either comfortable but I have small ears and always have that problem.  I use Blue cell replacement tips (small) and then these are ok.  They are lighter weight than the other active noise canceling units I have tried, so they do stay in my ear better and that also helps with the comfort.  The sound isolation is not great with the tips that come with the unit, but I find that to be somewhat personal and a function of the shape of your ear.<br /><br />There is a lot of noise transfer with these - when you move, the unit transmits a lot of crackling sound.  It doesn't matter if you have the noise canceling on or off.<br /><br />I haven't been in an environment where I can test the active noise canceling function yet, so I will update when I test that out.<br /><br />For those who don't know - earbuds (and for that matter headphones) can reduce noise in 2 ways - active and passive.  Passive noise reduction is often called sound isolation and this is based  on physically blocking the sound from getting into your ear.  Active noise reduction, often called noise canceling, works by the unit recording the ambient sound and essentially producing an opposite wave form to cancel out the sound.  Noise canceling works best with certain types of sounds - predictable, constant sounds (like jet engine noise) etc.  It does not work very well to reduce ambient conversation, for example, so if that is what you are looking for, you will be disapointed.",3.0,these are the best sounding ear buds i have tried so far and are certainly affordable there is no hiss when the noise canceling is on as there often is in other models the audio is clear in all ranges and neither too bright nor too muddybr br these come with silicone and memory foam tips i dont find either comfortable but i have small ears and always have that problem i use blue cell replacement tips small and then these are ok they are lighter weight than the other active noise canceling units i have tried so they do stay in my ear better and that also helps with the comfort the sound isolation is not great with the tips that come with the unit but i find that to be somewhat personal and a function of the shape of your earbr br there is a lot of noise transfer with these when you move the unit transmits a lot of crackling sound it doesnt matter if you have the noise canceling on or offbr br i havent been in an environment where i can test the active noise canceling function yet so i will update when i test that outbr br for those who dont know earbuds and for that matter headphones can reduce noise in ways active and passive passive noise reduction is often called sound isolation and this is based on physically blocking the sound from getting into your ear active noise reduction often called noise canceling works by the unit recording the ambient sound and essentially producing an opposite wave form to cancel out the sound noise canceling works best with certain types of sounds predictable constant sounds like jet engine noise etc it does not work very well to reduce ambient conversation for example so if that is what you are looking for you will be disapointed,1690

"The lightweight iPad cover is not red, more of a hot pink color FYI.<br />I needed to replace my old iPad cover and since its an older model there weren't that many offerings left in the official Apple leather case division. I decided to try out a Chinese manufactured foam case that mimics the leather flip fold of my original.<br />It fits fine. So that isn't a problem. The material is a kind of medium density one piece foam with magnets built into the lid flap. The sleep mode works just fine and the lid will put the iPad into sleep without a problem.

It only works (sort of) one way, unlike before where you could flip the triangle either in or out so achieve different standing angles. this misdesign also makes it hard to hold in folded mode.<br />After a few months of wear, the thin parts of the side (near cut outs) are loose and feel like they may break soon.<br />Im not displeased with the inexpensive case, but Do realize its limitations.

"[[VIDEOID:2e1e48afafe7261f888f4fa063c2dbdd]] I really like the fact that this is a larger display than the 7 inchers you usually find in car radio replacements. That's what initially attracted me to trying this unit, since my Toyota Solara's double din dash kit has tons of unused space to the right and left of the faceplate. The problem?<br />It's *slightly* too large vertically, and is centered instead of starting at the bottom. To explain: I measured my dashboard and realized it would stick up past the top and partially cover the bottom of my hazard button as well as the vents, but that's livable. I don't use the hazard button very often, and the vents can be adjusted away from it.  The problem is, it sticks out both top AND bottom, with the middle double-din sized part being centered in the display. That downward part concerns me because of my ability to turn the knobs for the climate control underneath. I wish that the unit started at the bottom of the double-din space and only went UP only. That's what I was expecting it to do, the way modern car radios have displays that stick out vertically but are flush with the dash underneath. I'm not ok with it rubbing against the climate knobs.<br />I took a video of trying to install it on my dash kit before I gave up and put it back in the box. I DID hook it up to 12v power just to see it turn on and make sure everything works, and I have to say it's a shame because this LOOKS really cool. I love that it runs Android and has all the customization I'd crave from a system like that. Android Auto is a treat too. I didn't hook up any speakers so I can't vouch for sound quality and I can't vouch for the longevity of the unit since I didn't actually keep it in my car, but it looks like a pretty good value for the money if this fits your dash layout.",3.0,videoideeafafefffacdbdd i really like the fact that this is a larger display than the inchers you usually find in car radio replacements thats what initially attracted me to trying this unit since my toyota solaras double din dash kit has tons of unused space to the right and left of the faceplate the problembr its slightly too large vertically and is centered instead of starting at the bottom to explain i measured my dashboard and realized it would stick up past the top and partially cover the bottom of my hazard button as well as the vents but thats livable i dont use the hazard button very often and the vents can be adjusted away from it the problem is it sticks out both top and bottom with the middle doubledin sized part being centered in the display that downward part concerns me because of my ability to turn the knobs for the climate control underneath i wish that the unit started at the bottom of the doubledin space and only went up only thats what i was expecting it to do the way modern car radios have displays that stick out vertically but are flush with the dash underneath im not ok with it rubbing against the climate knobsbr i took a video of trying to install it on my dash kit before i gave up and put it back in the box i did hook it up to v power just to see it turn on and make sure everything works and i have to say its a shame because this looks really cool i love that it runs android and has all the customization id crave from a system like that android auto is a treat too i didnt hook up any speakers so i cant vouch for sound quality and i cant vouch for the longevity of the unit since i didnt actually keep it in my car but it looks like a pretty good value for the money if this fits your dash layout,1746

"JBL's speaker products are usually quite good if you are willing to pay the price.  This speaker however doesn't sound so great even considering size.  Usually small speakers tent to be too bright.  This is the opposite.  Though not a boomer, it is pretty strong in the bass for it's size.  But using an eq to emphasize the mid-upper range only helps a little.  You cannot get a balanced spectrum.

"I bought mine direct from Samsung and ultimately returned them. I found that I had to fiddle with them constantly to hit the sweet spot for the music to sound like it should instead of like I was listening through a tin can, and while fiddling with them the touch controls become an annoying hassle because you are trying to get the fit right and the music is turning on and off and pausing and skipping, etc, because you are touching them. The buds can't seem to differentiate at all between an actual hold/grip to manipulate them in your ears, and a tap as you would do to actually use a touch control feature.<br /><br />Don't quote me on this because it's not like I counted every review that appeared male vs female, but I found that they hurt and I think it might be because they were designed by somewhat larger-eared males.  I originally assumed the hurty issue was likely because they were designed by some 60 year old man engineer with huge ears (because ears grow our whole lives) and so they were only made to fit kind of older larger ears. I even wrote on my Samsung review that they should have made the fit for the age group of their customer. But now, reading these Amazon reviews, I am noticing that the people saying they fit great seem to mostly be male names and those saying they hurt seem to mostly be female-normative names, so I still think they were designed for larger ears, but maybe for males they will fit better - I truly don't know how different in size male vs female ears are though; it's just a random observation of these reviews of hurt vs feel great.<br /><br />Bottom line, they hurt my ears and were too picky about being perfectly aligned in my ear.

"I'll start off with the good, This watch is quite comfortable to wear. Even though it's a bit on the large side, it's not super heavy on the wrist. The screen is quite bright and the touch sensitivity is just right. There are a wide variety of watch faces available within the app and the accompanying app is pretty easy to use and navigate. I also like that it integrates with Google Health system, that's super nice. The buttons work well and are quite tactile.<br /><br />What frustrates me are two things, navigation and customization. There are 3 different interaction mechanisms swipe side to side, a dial interface, and a sizeable 'system' menu that hides a lot of other function. It would be super nice to be able to customize which apps you see in the swipe left/right function, as the dial is a bit hard to accurately select the exact app you want to launch.

"I have a Kindle Keyboard, nee Kindle 3. I purchased the Kindle Touch as a ""lateral"" upgrade, since the Keyboard version is still currently in the same generation. So that will be the focus of my review.<br /><br />In short, if you have a Kindle Keyboard, don't bother upgrading.<br /><br />With the exception of the DX, I've owned every generation of the Kindle from the first, and have never been disappointed. For example, the difference between the K2 and K3 screens was immediately noticeable, and was well worth an upgrade.<br /><br />One of the marketing mantras from Amazon is that they want the ""Kindle to disappear in your hands"" or some such chant. This was true for every prior generation Kindle, but I'm not sure if this will be true of the Touch.<br /><br />The screen is deeply recessed, much more than prior versions, and if the reading light is not positioned properly, this deep recess will cause shadows. I figure the deeper recess is due to the addition of the touch mechanism. Unfortunately, which such a design point may seem small, this is one of the biggest negatives, as it has a direct impact on reading.<br /><br />I knew there was not going to be much of a major change between the Keyboard and the Touch, but I was ultimately interested in the smaller form factor of the Touch. Since I rarely used the keyboard, it is no loss, and rather a bonus.<br /><br />The power button remains in the same position, just near the USB connector, but they've changed it to a momentary push button, rather than the slider on the Keyboard. I've had the slider power switch on my Keyboard fail, necessitating a return to Amazon, and I've read other similar complaints, so I see this as a good thing. The only other button on the device is a square button at the bottom, which brings you to the home screen.<br /><br />Reading a book, the touch part works fine. Just tap the screen to advance pages. The screen refresh is different; on the Keyboard, the screen would refresh every page turn (that's the flash you see when changing pages), but on the Touch, it does not refresh every page. That makes page turning faster, and I hope will also give some additional battery life.<br /><br />While in the library, or in the Amazon Market (or your Archived Items), the touch method is a little different, as you need to use swipe gestures to page back and forth. If you've used a smart phone or tablet, you're probably used to such gestures, but be aware that the ""touch page turns"" is only applicable while reading a book.<br /><br />I also changed from a 3G Keyboard with no advertisements, to WiFi only with advertisements. I found myself disabling the 3G on the Keyboard, and since I don't travel, it won't be a loss. For those who ask, to disable 3G, simply configure WiFi. Once in range of a configured WiFi network, it'll use that over 3G.<br /><br />And with the new ""upgrade"" option allowing you to remove the advertisements, I figured this was a good chance to see if the advertisements are worth it. So far, no real opinion on that. They do eat up some screen space at the bottom of your library screen, which can be distracting if you're not used to it.<br /><br />The on-screen keyboard is fine, I have not had any real issues at all with it. Touching and dragging, to highlight phrases, takes a bit of patience, as it is a bit slow, and you may find yourself highlighting more than you intended. The built-in dictionary look-up is much improved over the Keyboard.<br /><br />Unlike the Keyboard, which has a progress bar at the bottom of the page, the progress bar is missing, instead being replaced with location and a percentage. I found the progress bar to be a great visual indicator, and I'm not sure if the percentage counter alone will be able to fit that feature.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I am indifferent to the Touch, compared to the Keyboard. If you have a Keyboard, I would say don't bother upgrading.<br /><br />If you're coming from a K1 or a K2, and can live without the keyboard, then definitely upgrade. Or if you're completely new to the Kindle family, then by all means, I'd say buy it.<br /><br />With a 30 day return policy, I am going to give the Touch a week or so before I ultimately consider returning it. I'd really like it to grow on me. In the meanwhile, I will not de-register my Keyboard, Just In Case.<br /><br />Edited on November 22: my Touch is on the way back to Amazon. The prior generations of the Kindle (the original, the Kindle 2 and then the Kindle 3) all generated insta-love. For me, the Touch didn't have it.",3.0,i have a kindle keyboard nee kindle i purchased the kindle touch as a lateral upgrade since the keyboard version is still currently in the same generation so that will be the focus of my reviewbr br in short if you have a kindle keyboard dont bother upgradingbr br with the exception of the dx ive owned every generation of the kindle from the first and have never been disappointed for example the difference between the k and k screens was immediately noticeable and was well worth an upgradebr br one of the marketing mantras from amazon is that they want the kindle to disappear in your hands or some such chant this was true for every prior generation kindle but im not sure if this will be true of the touchbr br the screen is deeply recessed much more than prior versions and if the reading light is not positioned properly this deep recess will cause shadows i figure the deeper recess is due to the addition of the touch mechanism unfortunately which such a design point may seem small this is one of the biggest negatives as it has a direct impact on readingbr br i knew there was not going to be much of a major change between the keyboard and the touch but i was ultimately interested in the smaller form factor of the touch since i rarely used the keyboard it is no loss and rather a bonusbr br the power button remains in the same position just near the usb connector but theyve changed it to a momentary push button rather than the slider on the keyboard ive had the slider power switch on my keyboard fail necessitating a return to amazon and ive read other similar complaints so i see this as a good thing the only other button on the device is a square button at the bottom which brings you to the home screenbr br reading a book the touch part works fine just tap the screen to advance pages the screen refresh is different on the keyboard the screen would refresh every page turn thats the flash you see when changing pages but on the touch it does not refresh every page that makes page turning faster and i hope will also give some additional battery lifebr br while in the library or in the amazon market or your archived items the touch method is a little different as you need to use swipe gestures to page back and forth if youve used a smart phone or tablet youre probably used to such gestures but be aware that the touch page turns is only applicable while reading a bookbr br i also changed from a g keyboard with no advertisements to wifi only with advertisements i found myself disabling the g on the keyboard and since i dont travel it wont be a loss for those who ask to disable g simply configure wifi once in range of a configured wifi network itll use that over gbr br and with the new upgrade option allowing you to remove the advertisements i figured this was a good chance to see if the advertisements are worth it so far no real opinion on that they do eat up some screen space at the bottom of your library screen which can be distracting if youre not used to itbr br the onscreen keyboard is fine i have not had any real issues at all with it touching and dragging to highlight phrases takes a bit of patience as it is a bit slow and you may find yourself highlighting more than you intended the builtin dictionary lookup is much improved over the keyboardbr br unlike the keyboard which has a progress bar at the bottom of the page the progress bar is missing instead being replaced with location and a percentage i found the progress bar to be a great visual indicator and im not sure if the percentage counter alone will be able to fit that featurebr br the bottom line is that i am indifferent to the touch compared to the keyboard if you have a keyboard i would say dont bother upgradingbr br if youre coming from a k or a k and can live without the keyboard then definitely upgrade or if youre completely new to the kindle family then by all means id say buy itbr br with a day return policy i am going to give the touch a week or so before i ultimately consider returning it id really like it to grow on me in the meanwhile i will not deregister my keyboard just in casebr br edited on november my touch is on the way back to amazon the prior generations of the kindle the original the kindle and then the kindle all generated instalove for me the touch didnt have it,4317

"I needed a quality headset at work, and at the gym.

"This has lots of nice little bells and whistles, and if I hadn't been looking specifically for a good ultra-zoom lightweight camera I probably would be happy. The color is nice. It has lots of modes, but I found that I couldn't really use aperture priority or shutter priority if the light was low, it would tell me to open the flash, so I had to use manual.  The automatic modes are nice, you even have in-camera HDR and panorama mode.  I played with the panorama mode a bit for the fun of it. The macro mode is really a closeup mode, not real macro.  But the main falling point is the ultra zoom. It really doesn't give you 1200mm.  You have to lower the megapixels per shot to get more zoom, resulting in a fuzzier and fuzzier picture.  No 16mp shots at 1200mm.  I think you might get it at .03 mp, the smallest number. I went down to 3mp, and got fuzzy pictures at 108x (120 x is the maximum range of the lens).

"When it works it's great. But... the first one I got could not be activated by Comcast. It was refurbished by seller and Comcast's system reported that the MAC number was for a different model number. I spent at least 3 hours on the phone with Comcast trying to get this cleared up to no avail. I think the refurbisher mixed and matched parts from different models.<br /><br />Second one worked perfectly. Got it activated for internet using the comcast website. Not a hint of a problem. The telephone function didn't activate on the website though. I called and got someone good (after maybe 6 or 7 service calls to Comcast I know the difference and not many of the others were remotely good). He got my phone up and running in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's the modem or Comcast (I'm a new comcast internet user), but there does seem to be an inordinate amount of latency on the connection. Speed is good, much better than the DLS line I had been using, but there is a latency lag that approaches annoying, even extremely annoying, at times. Could be a fact of life with comcast or could be the modem. I don't know.<br /><br />In any case, we can stream anything on multiple machines, something we couldn't do on our DSL using AT&T's antiquated copper, so I'm happy.<br /><br />If you decide to buy your own modem instead of paying comcast, be aware that comcast is no fun to deal with on the phone -- but you already knew that, didn't you?

"Pretty much every other stand-alone PTZ camera I have bought in the past worked roughly the same and supported the same software. The ONVIF standard usually makes it simple to configure these cameras to whatever type of hardware or software you want to use it with. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case with this product.<br /><br />No matter what I do I can not get this camera to work properly with my ONVIF compliant hardware or software programs or apps. I can get the video configured to work on some of my devices but no amount of adjustments will make the PTZ feature work, which is the biggest reason for wanting to buy this camera in the first place. I also can't set a static IP address for this camera. It only seems to want to work on DHCP, which is obviously less than ideal.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you can get it to work and take a picture, the picture quality is very good. Even the night vision works well. Without the ability to move the camera lens though, this camera is pretty much dead in the water so far as I am concerned.",3.0,pretty much every other standalone ptz camera i have bought in the past worked roughly the same and supported the same software the onvif standard usually makes it simple to configure these cameras to whatever type of hardware or software you want to use it with unfortunately that does not seem to be the case with this productbr br no matter what i do i can not get this camera to work properly with my onvif compliant hardware or software programs or apps i can get the video configured to work on some of my devices but no amount of adjustments will make the ptz feature work which is the biggest reason for wanting to buy this camera in the first place i also cant set a static ip address for this camera it only seems to want to work on dhcp which is obviously less than idealbr br on the bright side if you can get it to work and take a picture the picture quality is very good even the night vision works well without the ability to move the camera lens though this camera is pretty much dead in the water so far as i am concerned,1038

"I'm not sure where to start this review. First of all, the boxes containing all the equipment were sealed as tight as Fort Knox and it took forever to open them. I wish now I would have simply ripped the boxes open. Installation of the cameras is not difficult. We ran the wires through our attic and the cameras were easily mounted onto the soffitt. Note: these cameras must be mounted from the top and not the side or the image will be turned. Setting the DVR up locally was a piece of cake. You plug in all the wires to the back of the DVR, turn it on, and the cameras are up and running. The images are clear, the cameras record fine, even at night. Bugs flying in front of the cameras will start the recording process. We are still fine tuning the settings to block out moving tree limbs and shrubs. You can set the sensitivity of each camera as well as adjust the color.<br /><br />Our first problem was trying to hook the DVR up to our HD TV. Our TV has no VGA outlet, so we purchased a HDMI converter, which added to the cost. One of the features of this system is remote access to view your cameras from the internet -- anywhere in the world they say -- or on your smartphone. After several calls to Tech Support (and holding for over 30 minutes each time), we could not get the system to work remotely. We learned a few things. The system uses Port 80. Check with your ISP because most of them block Port 80 (some may unblock it for a monthly fee). There is a working way around this on another port, but you must use a PC computer for this. They don't tell you this on their website nor is it in the manual. (The system will work fine on a Mac locally but it must use Port 80 for remote access.)<br /><br />After 90 minutes with Tech Support on the last call, they were unable to get the email set up to work. You hate it when a tech person says, ""I don't know why this isn't working."" He had taken control of the computer and DVR and was setting this up. Basically, we've spent approximately 6 hours on the phone between Night Owl, our ISP and the manufacturer of our router (each blaming the other) trying to get this system to work properly -- and it's still not working the way this system should.<br /><br />I will give kudos to their Pro app because the setup works flawlessly on our smartphones. You can snap pictures from the cameras, save the video, manage your DVR from your phone. You will need to make sure you're using a wi-fi connection since the data runs constantly.<br /><br />The manual that comes with this system is very basic. There is a lot of missing information that you find out only after you've had to call them. If you've got the IT skills, you're still going to encounter problems. And the cameras have to be already installed in order to set everything else up, so it's too late to pull the wires back out, unmount the cameras, box it all up, and ship it back.<br /><br />We're still ironing out the bugs and hope to eventually get things set up to where all the features work the way they should. Night Owl's tech support is 24/7 and unlimited, so we're not giving up just yet.",3.0,im not sure where to start this review first of all the boxes containing all the equipment were sealed as tight as fort knox and it took forever to open them i wish now i would have simply ripped the boxes open installation of the cameras is not difficult we ran the wires through our attic and the cameras were easily mounted onto the soffitt note these cameras must be mounted from the top and not the side or the image will be turned setting the dvr up locally was a piece of cake you plug in all the wires to the back of the dvr turn it on and the cameras are up and running the images are clear the cameras record fine even at night bugs flying in front of the cameras will start the recording process we are still fine tuning the settings to block out moving tree limbs and shrubs you can set the sensitivity of each camera as well as adjust the colorbr br our first problem was trying to hook the dvr up to our hd tv our tv has no vga outlet so we purchased a hdmi converter which added to the cost one of the features of this system is remote access to view your cameras from the internet anywhere in the world they say or on your smartphone after several calls to tech support and holding for over minutes each time we could not get the system to work remotely we learned a few things the system uses port check with your isp because most of them block port some may unblock it for a monthly fee there is a working way around this on another port but you must use a pc computer for this they dont tell you this on their website nor is it in the manual the system will work fine on a mac locally but it must use port for remote accessbr br after minutes with tech support on the last call they were unable to get the email set up to work you hate it when a tech person says i dont know why this isnt working he had taken control of the computer and dvr and was setting this up basically weve spent approximately hours on the phone between night owl our isp and the manufacturer of our router each blaming the other trying to get this system to work properly and its still not working the way this system shouldbr br i will give kudos to their pro app because the setup works flawlessly on our smartphones you can snap pictures from the cameras save the video manage your dvr from your phone you will need to make sure youre using a wifi connection since the data runs constantlybr br the manual that comes with this system is very basic there is a lot of missing information that you find out only after youve had to call them if youve got the it skills youre still going to encounter problems and the cameras have to be already installed in order to set everything else up so its too late to pull the wires back out unmount the cameras box it all up and ship it backbr br were still ironing out the bugs and hope to eventually get things set up to where all the features work the way they should night owls tech support is and unlimited so were not giving up just yet,2976

"As is clearly stated in the product description and other reviews, there are no threads in bottom plate's hole.  I thought I could get around this by drilling into said hole with a 3/8 drill bit to create threads, then screwing in a 3/8 to 1/4 20 thread adapter bushing.  I drilled the hole and screwed in the adapter thinking I was a genius, but the the bottom plate is designed in such a way that the adapter remains recessed into the plate rather than flush with the bottom of the plate.  In other words, no 1/4 20 thread screw can fit up into the bushing from the bottom.  These would work great if you are building something that allows a bolt to be driven in through the top of the bottom plate to secure it to your rig.  If you don't intend to use this product in that way and want something that adapts it to your existing gear, stay away from these and get something designed for that purpose for a few dollars more.",3.0,as is clearly stated in the product description and other reviews there are no threads in bottom plates hole i thought i could get around this by drilling into said hole with a drill bit to create threads then screwing in a to thread adapter bushing i drilled the hole and screwed in the adapter thinking i was a genius but the the bottom plate is designed in such a way that the adapter remains recessed into the plate rather than flush with the bottom of the plate in other words no thread screw can fit up into the bushing from the bottom these would work great if you are building something that allows a bolt to be driven in through the top of the bottom plate to secure it to your rig if you dont intend to use this product in that way and want something that adapts it to your existing gear stay away from these and get something designed for that purpose for a few dollars more,885

"Other reviewers have pointed out that the case of this power strip is metal. That is correct.

"I've had the Dell Inspiron 17R (500 gig hard drive; 4 gigs RAM; i5-2410m processor) for about a month. I upgraded it to 6 gigs of RAM.<br /><br />The Inspiron is a pretty good value.  You get a lot of machine for the money.  The i5-2410m processor is fast.  Combined with the large amount of RAM, it'll handle with ease any normal, everyday task, such as watching movies, browsing, word processing, home video editing, and so on.  I can't speak to whether it'd be suitable for gaming, because I don't use it for that. However, it is quite a powerful laptop for routine computer stuff.<br /><br />I have seen the screen criticized elsewhere, for not being super-high resolution, but I disagree.  The 17.3"" screen is one of the high points of this laptop.  It is bright, sharp, and easy to read.  I've always been a fan of ""desktop replacement"" laptops, and have several over the years, always with a 17"" screen. I think this is one of the better screens out there.  It's 1600x900, which is not 1920x1080, but it's still very sharp, and the Inspiron 17R is half the price of a 1920x1080 laptop.<br /><br />It comes with a nice mix of ports. Two USB 3.0, a USB 2.0, and an extremely useful eSATAe.  The USB3.0 ports are not providing the kind of performance I was hoping for.  I think that either the laptop or my external drives are not configured properly to take advantage of USB3.0.  I'm getting USB3.0 speeds that are little better than USB2.0.  On the other hand, the eSATAe port is blazin' fast.  I plan just to use the eSATAe port and not bother with the 3.0 ports.<br /><br />My main complaint with this laptop is the mouse pad.  There are some laptops out there that have a mouse which jumps around too much.  This is one of them. Many other laptops do not have this problem anymore; it was a design problem that was fixed over the years.  So, what does this problem entail?  When you're typing, the cursor will occasionally jump elsewhere on the screen, and if you're not careful, you can end up deleting important text.  And, as another reviewer noted, there's the occasional related problem of the mouse-pointer sort of pinning itself to the right side of the screen; when this happens, nothing you do on the mousepad will unstick it, and you just have to fuss with it and, ultimately, wait for it to decide to start working again.  Experimenting with the mouse pad controls (sensitivity and speed, in Control Panel) helps a little, but not a lot. Fundamentally, it is just a bad mouse pad, something that should have been addressed by Dell and put to rest a long, long time ago.  The cursor-jumpiness around the screen is just unacceptable on a modern laptop.  The keyboard itself is mediocre; it has nice chicklet-style keys that are easy to type on, but they occasionally miss a letter when they shouldn't.  I spilled just a couple of drops of Diet Coke on one key, and now that key and six surrounding keys have permanent pop-and-crackle noises when I touch them.  Many (in fact, ""most"" or ""all"") other laptop keyboards are more mishap-tolerant than the one in the 17R. I want to love this laptop, but I have to say that laptops from other brands such as Toshiba have much better keyboards and mouse pads.<br /><br />The battery life is poor.  It is the shortest battery life I have ever experienced on a laptop.  You can get about 90 minutes if you are doing light browsing.  Any sort of heavy usage, like movie-watching, will put you down in the 60 to 75 minute range.  I really don't get that.  I've had other 17"" monitor laptops that ran for 2.5 to 3.5 hours between charges.  It doesn't bother me much, because I use it at home, where it's plugged in.  If I was in more of a road-warrior mode, I would've already returned it.  This laptop basically needs to be plugged in when you're using it.  It is also very heavy - substantially heavier than my last couple of 17"" laptops.  It really is not designed for road use, either in battery usage or weight; it's truly an old-school desktop replacement laptop.<br /><br />In summary: for the price, you get a lot of laptop with Dell.  The Inspiron 17R has a beautiful screen, a very fast processor, and ample storage and RAM for normal business or personal use.  I don't think for the $600 to $700 (depending on configuration) you can get much more laptop elsewhere.  However, the mouse, and specifically the jumpiness of the mouse, truly sucks.  The keyboard is very low-end -- so low-end it's hard to believe Dell thought this was an acceptable component to put on a modern, $600 machine.  All in all, I give this laptop 3 stars.  I would like to see Dell really drill down on why their mousepads and keyboards are not up to the competition, and replace them with better parts.  I have a feeling this one will last about a year or two, and then I will probably replace it with a different brand.",3.0,ive had the dell inspiron r gig hard drive gigs ram im processor for about a month i upgraded it to gigs of rambr br the inspiron is a pretty good value you get a lot of machine for the money the im processor is fast combined with the large amount of ram itll handle with ease any normal everyday task such as watching movies browsing word processing home video editing and so on i cant speak to whether itd be suitable for gaming because i dont use it for that however it is quite a powerful laptop for routine computer stuffbr br i have seen the screen criticized elsewhere for not being superhigh resolution but i disagree the screen is one of the high points of this laptop it is bright sharp and easy to read ive always been a fan of desktop replacement laptops and have several over the years always with a screen i think this is one of the better screens out there its x which is not x but its still very sharp and the inspiron r is half the price of a x laptopbr br it comes with a nice mix of ports two usb a usb and an extremely useful esatae the usb ports are not providing the kind of performance i was hoping for i think that either the laptop or my external drives are not configured properly to take advantage of usb im getting usb speeds that are little better than usb on the other hand the esatae port is blazin fast i plan just to use the esatae port and not bother with the portsbr br my main complaint with this laptop is the mouse pad there are some laptops out there that have a mouse which jumps around too much this is one of them many other laptops do not have this problem anymore it was a design problem that was fixed over the years so what does this problem entail when youre typing the cursor will occasionally jump elsewhere on the screen and if youre not careful you can end up deleting important text and as another reviewer noted theres the occasional related problem of the mousepointer sort of pinning itself to the right side of the screen when this happens nothing you do on the mousepad will unstick it and you just have to fuss with it and ultimately wait for it to decide to start working again experimenting with the mouse pad controls sensitivity and speed in control panel helps a little but not a lot fundamentally it is just a bad mouse pad something that should have been addressed by dell and put to rest a long long time ago the cursorjumpiness around the screen is just unacceptable on a modern laptop the keyboard itself is mediocre it has nice chickletstyle keys that are easy to type on but they occasionally miss a letter when they shouldnt i spilled just a couple of drops of diet coke on one key and now that key and six surrounding keys have permanent popandcrackle noises when i touch them many in fact most or all other laptop keyboards are more mishaptolerant than the one in the r i want to love this laptop but i have to say that laptops from other brands such as toshiba have much better keyboards and mouse padsbr br the battery life is poor it is the shortest battery life i have ever experienced on a laptop you can get about minutes if you are doing light browsing any sort of heavy usage like moviewatching will put you down in the to minute range i really dont get that ive had other monitor laptops that ran for to hours between charges it doesnt bother me much because i use it at home where its plugged in if i was in more of a roadwarrior mode i wouldve already returned it this laptop basically needs to be plugged in when youre using it it is also very heavy substantially heavier than my last couple of laptops it really is not designed for road use either in battery usage or weight its truly an oldschool desktop replacement laptopbr br in summary for the price you get a lot of laptop with dell the inspiron r has a beautiful screen a very fast processor and ample storage and ram for normal business or personal use i dont think for the to depending on configuration you can get much more laptop elsewhere however the mouse and specifically the jumpiness of the mouse truly sucks the keyboard is very lowend so lowend its hard to believe dell thought this was an acceptable component to put on a modern machine all in all i give this laptop stars i would like to see dell really drill down on why their mousepads and keyboards are not up to the competition and replace them with better parts i have a feeling this one will last about a year or two and then i will probably replace it with a different brand,4487

"I've had this now for several weeks and have used this side by side with my Navigon.  Living in Northern Virginia, traffic can be a problem, and changing routes is very normal.  With the Nextar SNAP5, I can be miles down the road before it kicks in with another route.  More disconcerting is  driving East on I-66 in Falls Church, and having the voice tell me I am going West.  When signage tells me I'm going a direction, the compass tells me I'm going in that same direction and the GPS voice tells me differently, I panic and want to pull off the road but I know better.  This system is large in screen, but that screen displays many icons and a map that is eclipsed by the Navigon 4.3 smaller size in package.  Startup is much faster in the Navigon than the Nextar SNAP5 under the exact same conditions, as I turn them on at the same time in the same place and wait for the navigation to begin.  It has taken me in very complicated and inefficient routes which would make Euler roll in his grave.  The text to voice function is less clear than the Navigon and the voice often breaks in and out with delivery, making the words unrecognizable.  I do not like the coiled cable at all, but do like the placement of the connection better than the one on the Navigon.  The map representation on the screen is unappealing and difficult to read in either option available and it's extremely difficult to see during bright days.  I sometimes cannot identify the map at all, regardless of how I position and reposition the device.  I have not used the MP3 function and never will, so that's wasted on me.  The POI's are nicely organized and it's interesting to find spots from a database that is very outdated which haven't existed for years.  It's a great concept if it is current but otherwise is a waste of time and can cause problems if you head to a spot that doesn't exist.  I do not know if updates are available as they are (with subscription purchase) for the Navigon.  This also does not have a traffic update availability as does the Navigon.  Since I don't use it without power from the vehicle, I cannot comment upon the battery life.  A stylus is included, but I also haven't used that expect in a rare occasion.  The carrying case is nice if you want to carry it, but I have yet to use the case.  Very nice to have a power cord to charge it away from the car.  All in all, the price of less than a hundred and a half is reasonable if you want the MP3 function but for me, I much prefer the Navigon.",3.0,ive had this now for several weeks and have used this side by side with my navigon living in northern virginia traffic can be a problem and changing routes is very normal with the nextar snap i can be miles down the road before it kicks in with another route more disconcerting is driving east on i in falls church and having the voice tell me i am going west when signage tells me im going a direction the compass tells me im going in that same direction and the gps voice tells me differently i panic and want to pull off the road but i know better this system is large in screen but that screen displays many icons and a map that is eclipsed by the navigon smaller size in package startup is much faster in the navigon than the nextar snap under the exact same conditions as i turn them on at the same time in the same place and wait for the navigation to begin it has taken me in very complicated and inefficient routes which would make euler roll in his grave the text to voice function is less clear than the navigon and the voice often breaks in and out with delivery making the words unrecognizable i do not like the coiled cable at all but do like the placement of the connection better than the one on the navigon the map representation on the screen is unappealing and difficult to read in either option available and its extremely difficult to see during bright days i sometimes cannot identify the map at all regardless of how i position and reposition the device i have not used the mp function and never will so thats wasted on me the pois are nicely organized and its interesting to find spots from a database that is very outdated which havent existed for years its a great concept if it is current but otherwise is a waste of time and can cause problems if you head to a spot that doesnt exist i do not know if updates are available as they are with subscription purchase for the navigon this also does not have a traffic update availability as does the navigon since i dont use it without power from the vehicle i cannot comment upon the battery life a stylus is included but i also havent used that expect in a rare occasion the carrying case is nice if you want to carry it but i have yet to use the case very nice to have a power cord to charge it away from the car all in all the price of less than a hundred and a half is reasonable if you want the mp function but for me i much prefer the navigon,2421

"I switch between a Logitech M570 (thumb trackball) and a Logitech MX Master 3 (regular mouse) daily, so I couldn’t help but compare the ProtoArc Trackball to the devices I use daily. For me, it’s not a worthy replacement. It’s a backup mouse, or one to take traveling with me when I’m worried my favorite mice might get damaged or lost.<br /><br />I do really like the adjustable angle of the mouse itself. The base allows you to set the mouse at 0 degrees or 20 degrees. That feature drew me to the trackball, and I think it’s implemented well. The mouse is rock steady at 0 or 20 degrees, but it’s easy to switch between the options. And because it’s built in, there are no extra parts to carry or worry about losing. For me, the 20 degree angle feels very natural, and that’s the one thing I miss when I go back to my usual mice.<br /><br />The trackball itself feels sluggish and inconsistent. I’ve tried adjusting the DPI, but that’s not the problem. Sometimes the ball registers the movement of my thumb and sometimes it doesn’t. I did check the ball and sensors; they are clean. The ball is actually hard to pop out, I needed to stick a pen through the small hole to get it out.<br /><br />The left and right click are soft and muted sounding.

"As far as basic function, it's fine. I bought a clock radio and that's what I got. HOWEVER... there were 2 main things I cared about - radio alarm (win) and the ability to dim the clock (fail).

We have to turn the clock away from us at night because it's so bright.<br /><br />On top of that, I think they tried to get overly fancy/complicated with their buttons. I'd rather an on/off switch for the alarm, but there's a button you have to push.

"It does what I bought it for: provide network storage. I've tried a few packages as well (Synology Notes & Office mainly), but find the additional software packages rather disappointing, but again, I didn't buy it for that. I run the NAS with two 14TB Toshiba drives as well as two Samsung 980 NVME M.2 drives as cache. Performance is excellent in that setup.<br /><br />The main reasons for ""just"" a three star rating at:<br /><br />1) The build quality is seriously cheap. It's a cheap plastic housing that amplifies the rattling noise from a seeking drive. The slides are pure plastic and if you plan to use these often, there is a good likelihood you'll break one. The doors on the SSD slots are cheapo plastic as well and the drives themselves are held in with plastic clips that feel likely to break. I don't plan to change my drives in the next few years and I'm not planning on touching the NVME drives either, so it's not a big issue for me, but I'm REALLY disappointed in the overall feel of the housing.<br /><br />2) The additional software is not great (this is on DSM7.1). As soon as I installed some of the packages (namely Notes and Office, both Synology products) the NAS woke the HDDs from Hibernation every 20 to 30 minutes – like clockwork actually. I had to remove all installed packages to get HDD hibernation back and even now it's not reliable, even when I disconnect the network and have no tasks configured It only wakes up every few hours now, so it's tolerable. The quality of the Notes package is meh, every cheap notes app you get on any of the relevant app stores is MILES ahead. Cannot recommend. The office package might be usable for some, but it doesn't work well for me. I'll keep to either actual Office documents (MS Office, Apple Apps, ...) on the NAS drives or just use Google docs.<br /><br />3) The available logs in the interface are pretty much useless. I was trying to debug the HDD hibernation issue and it was just trial and error. If I find a log entry telling me the drive had to be started, I'd also expect a REASON (e.g. client connect, web connect, WOL, whatever – just give me SOMETHING).<br /><br />4) I wish it had 2.5Gbit/s ethernet. It's okay for me, but we are only two people working in the network, so the load is low, but I still wish I could saturate fast drives (e.g. if cached to/from NVME drive) – come on, I have two 1TB cache drives in there, these could actually be used better.<br /><br />5) The RAM is on the low side. I recommend getting a RAM module (still waiting for mine). I have hit high memory utilization a few time with just playing around, not even a single docker container running. Starting out with 2GB is just a bit too low. 4GB would be great, especially if it was a removable module (which it isn't as far as I know).<br /><br />Reasons why it's still good and why I'm reasonably happy with it:<br /><br />1) File transfers are very reliable, zero issues there. I still have to test out encryption, but I don't expect too much trouble since the CPU can handle it and the network interface is slow anyways.<br /><br />2) It supports all the protocols I need (SMB, AFP, NFS).<br /><br />3) As silly as it sounds, but I like the fact that I can dim the LEDs and even turn them off based on a schedule.<br /><br />So, overall a decent NAS, but if you are thinking of buying today, I'd wait for the next generation.

It is very easy to download books and to access my library; it is also easy to locate different pages in the book.<br /><br />However, the reason I rated the PaperWhite a 3 is because of the page turning (I have had no further problems with the refresh).

"I had already installed the PXAMG interface to allow me to plug my iPod into the car's audio system.<br /><br />When the factory Acura Bluetooth Handsfreelink transceiver failed and I could no longer make or answer my iPhone 4 handsfree (without spending $700 at the dealer!) I installed this ISBT21 Bluetooth interface, hoping for the best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- excellent audio quality for streaming Bluetooth content from the iPhone 4 to the 2005 TL's (non-navi) factory radio<br />  * the ""2"" key on the radio becomes the pause/play button<br />  * the buttons on the steering wheel control next/previous track selection<br />- easy install:<br />  * a DIN plug easily inserts into an existing socket on the PXAMG<br />  * An external mic plugs into the ISBT21 that allows you to do voice commanded phone calls using the iPhone's voice recognition<br />- accesses all phone numbers on the phone (as opposed to Acura's Handsfreelink system that makes you ""teach"" the car each number manually...a real pain.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Incoming phone audio is way, WAY too loud and distorted. A note says to control incoming phone audio via the volume buttons on the phone. So if you are listening to the streaming content at a given volume and you make a phone call or somebody calls you, it's really annoying. You have to turn the radio's volume control down immediately and a lot to get it down to a reasonable volume. But the phone voice quality is still distorted. It's like the ISBT21 is not matching the impedance or something. Almost like jamming line level into a mic level input.<br />- Menu is dicey<br />  * When you want to adjust the outgoing mic volume or the incoming speaker volume, you press button 6 (supposedly) to display the menu. It may or may not do this. And the generic instructions that come with the unit simply don't reflect how my radio looks. Buttons they call out don't even exist on my radio. Bottom line: it's very clumsy to adjust the Settings.<br />- Fails to connect often<br />  * I get into the car and fire it up and it may or may not find my phone. I have to call up the phone's Settings/General/Bluetooth and click on the ""PhoneKit"" to get it to connect. This is after you have initially paired the unit, which is easy enough.<br />- Can't recognize my voice command that well<br /><br />I really, really wanted this to work.

"Bought for T-295.  It does what is asked to do.  The keyboard is nice and a size we do not seem to be able to buy separately.

"They make it sound like anyone buying this 2.5"" SATA III Solid-State Drive (240 GB) can install it. Not so much. I figured my new gaming computer, which already had one SSD with a SATA connection, would be able to accommodate this new drive.  The drive comes with a brief set of directions--basically, turn off the power, remove the cover, connect the drive into the SATA power connector and the SATA connector on your motherboard. Well, it isn't clear where that is on my computer, so I watched a youtube on installing a SSD. He said you need to buy connectors (or they should be included with the drive, but they aren't). His computer interior looks a lot different than mine, so the video was of no help. So...I suppose I'll have to pay someone to install it.

"I hope you take a look at jjceo's video review.  It is very helpful.  I just evaluate things a bit differently.  This MatchStick isn't that impressive.  I see others are less than happy with the footprint.  For me that isn't a problem and I think Grace Digital did a nice job in linking the Kindle Fire to the unit so you can easily go from portrait to landscape.  However, the whole point of going this route is to enjoy the audio experience and, the wider footprint should allow bigger, better speakers.  Fidelity and dynamic range don't seem high priorities.  This means the resulting sound is very flat.  If Grace Digital, using the same footprint, had used larger vertical speakers they probably could have easily cured this.<br />Controls on the front have a good feel and work well.  Short cord and awkward back connections make me glad that don't need to fuss with them too often.<br />MatchStick does the thing I need, which is to have a nice way to easily play my Fire and keep it charged up.  I am sure there will be better alternatives available, so check back<br /><br />**** After six months we have gotten comfortable living together.

"When this camera came out it had a good number of features at around $100 price point. The resolution was high enough for the time and it had image stabilization. This was a present for my mother, and she liked it initially. While the image quality was not great, over time two issues stood out.<br /><br />One of the main short comings of this camera is the hard to see LCD screen. It's useless in daylight. This is the primary reason why it was eventually replaced with a different model. The second reason was its use of AA batteries.<br /><br />Using AA batteries is not a feature. When I bought this, I was convinced that having the ability to take AA batteries would be a plus. In practice our Ni-mh batteries were always in need of a recharging when the camera needed to be used. We also went through a few cheap chargers, which seemed to have a habit of dieing. Using AA alkaline batteries is not a solution since they only allow for a few pictures. In order to make this practical, one needs to put some money in to a good charger and low discharge rechargeable batteries. But by doing so the camera will end up costing you more money over time than a more expensive camera with a Lithium-ion battery.<br /><br />Normally we gift away our older digital cameras, but this one isn't going to be gifted away do to those two reasons.",3.0,when this camera came out it had a good number of features at around price point the resolution was high enough for the time and it had image stabilization this was a present for my mother and she liked it initially while the image quality was not great over time two issues stood outbr br one of the main short comings of this camera is the hard to see lcd screen its useless in daylight this is the primary reason why it was eventually replaced with a different model the second reason was its use of aa batteriesbr br using aa batteries is not a feature when i bought this i was convinced that having the ability to take aa batteries would be a plus in practice our nimh batteries were always in need of a recharging when the camera needed to be used we also went through a few cheap chargers which seemed to have a habit of dieing using aa alkaline batteries is not a solution since they only allow for a few pictures in order to make this practical one needs to put some money in to a good charger and low discharge rechargeable batteries but by doing so the camera will end up costing you more money over time than a more expensive camera with a lithiumion batterybr br normally we gift away our older digital cameras but this one isnt going to be gifted away do to those two reasons,1289

"These bluetooth earbuds have been a very mixed experience so far for me. First serious pair I've gotten that I plan to use after this, and already I anticipate being very annoyed by these little issues I have now. Got this for review purposes, but I am not inclined or obligated to give it a nice review. This will not be one.<br /><br />Audio quality wise, they're good. They have really nice clarity, they're good and loud if you want them to be, and cancel the whole world around you out. I would say they are better than the Apple AirPods I got a hold of, but those were not in good shape so can't really say. Not better than my Bose Micro Soundlink Speaker, but that's a speaker versus Earbuds. Different ballpark.<br /><br />Material wise, I really find them cheap feeling. The outer case looks like cheap plastic, and feels sturdy but still cheap. Like a 30~45$ pair. The lid has a magnet on it to keep it closed, but due to the low weight or design of the lid, it snaps shut quickly even when you really didn't want that. Making you have to open it again or again after that because you opened it just a little too fast, with too much force. That was bad design. It makes it feel cheaper. The actual Earbuds feel cheap yet sturdy just like the case, both are very lightweight, for better or worse. Finish is definitely far worse than Apple offerings over the years.<br /><br />Finally comfort and usability. Comfort wise, for brief maybe 30 minute sessions, they're fine. Anything longer and the inside of your ear hurts. It was not well contoured for long use.<br /><br />Usability, Battery life seems great so far, but haven't had alot of time to really dig deep, but anything above 4 hours for me is plenty. First connection I had issues with only 1 speaker coming on and connecting, then I had connection issues to my laptop, after that it worked flawlessly more or less. I hate the way they did the touch control, when you put it on, you put your hand where it is, so it instantly wants to turn on stuff you may not want yet. It's also not responsive enough, so you may hit it again, find it did what you wanted, then shut off what you wanted immediately after. Annoying. Outside of that, with my phone, if it is not constantly playing something, connection goes in and out, in and out, and when you have them in your air constantly talking about losing and gaining connection? That is really frustrating, makes me wonder if that's an issue with my set, my phone, or if that's just an issue of them. I am very unsure how taking calls would be with this if that's an actual issue that plagues it.<br /><br />Overall, or my TLDR to anyone who doesn't like my long wordy paragraphs, this set is okay? Audio is great, but the comfort is not made for even remotely long sessions, anything over 30 minutes hurts the inside of your ear. The build is cheap feeling but sturdy, though lacking in weight as well. The battery life seems excellent, but unfortunately, the usability is not as good as I expect. The way the touch control works can be frustrating, and I've had connection issues when I am not actively playing something on them with my phone. Can I recommend them for the price? No. I can't. I can't muster a 2 star review because they do have that great audio quality, and I will continue to use them. But, I also can't say it's worth 100$ when they feel like 40$ earbuds, and if they were, then I could overlook all this. At 40$, great buy, at 100$, too overpriced for what you get.",3.0,these bluetooth earbuds have been a very mixed experience so far for me first serious pair ive gotten that i plan to use after this and already i anticipate being very annoyed by these little issues i have now got this for review purposes but i am not inclined or obligated to give it a nice review this will not be onebr br audio quality wise theyre good they have really nice clarity theyre good and loud if you want them to be and cancel the whole world around you out i would say they are better than the apple airpods i got a hold of but those were not in good shape so cant really say not better than my bose micro soundlink speaker but thats a speaker versus earbuds different ballparkbr br material wise i really find them cheap feeling the outer case looks like cheap plastic and feels sturdy but still cheap like a pair the lid has a magnet on it to keep it closed but due to the low weight or design of the lid it snaps shut quickly even when you really didnt want that making you have to open it again or again after that because you opened it just a little too fast with too much force that was bad design it makes it feel cheaper the actual earbuds feel cheap yet sturdy just like the case both are very lightweight for better or worse finish is definitely far worse than apple offerings over the yearsbr br finally comfort and usability comfort wise for brief maybe minute sessions theyre fine anything longer and the inside of your ear hurts it was not well contoured for long usebr br usability battery life seems great so far but havent had alot of time to really dig deep but anything above hours for me is plenty first connection i had issues with only speaker coming on and connecting then i had connection issues to my laptop after that it worked flawlessly more or less i hate the way they did the touch control when you put it on you put your hand where it is so it instantly wants to turn on stuff you may not want yet its also not responsive enough so you may hit it again find it did what you wanted then shut off what you wanted immediately after annoying outside of that with my phone if it is not constantly playing something connection goes in and out in and out and when you have them in your air constantly talking about losing and gaining connection that is really frustrating makes me wonder if thats an issue with my set my phone or if thats just an issue of them i am very unsure how taking calls would be with this if thats an actual issue that plagues itbr br overall or my tldr to anyone who doesnt like my long wordy paragraphs this set is okay audio is great but the comfort is not made for even remotely long sessions anything over minutes hurts the inside of your ear the build is cheap feeling but sturdy though lacking in weight as well the battery life seems excellent but unfortunately the usability is not as good as i expect the way the touch control works can be frustrating and ive had connection issues when i am not actively playing something on them with my phone can i recommend them for the price no i cant i cant muster a star review because they do have that great audio quality and i will continue to use them but i also cant say its worth when they feel like earbuds and if they were then i could overlook all this at great buy at too overpriced for what you get,3323

"This Parrot Asteroid Android-powered car stereo, which is ipod, iphone, ipad compatible, provides the best phone and audio streaming I've ever used. It's great to have a built in Bluetooth for hands free calling and audio, as well as a built in amplifier. This car stereo can also have a lot of other great features if you are willing to spend a small fortune.<br /><br />AUDIO: One thing to note, is the digital media receiver with AM/FM toner doesn't play cd's. You can play audio files from USB memory devices and SD cards. There is a great voice control feature for the music selection. You simply say the artist or album title to search for your songs. It has a 7 band equalizer for tweaking with 9 pre-sets and a virtual super bass effect for enhancing low frequency music. The Android radio will only work with the iphone. For internet music, you need to purchase a broadband dongle and a paid for internet plan.<br /><br />PHONE: Asteroid synchronizes your phone book and sets up voice recognition, which is easy to see on the 3.2 inch screen. You hear every caller's words very clear. You can pair up to 10 phones. Iphones work, Android phones don't, because the Android processor does not control your Android phone, which makes no sense.<br /><br />APPS: Asteroid includes 5 Apps which all need an internet connection to function. This means you need to purchase an internet connection plan and a USB broadband dongle. Once you purchase the plan and dongle, the Radio App lets you tune into over 50,000 stations from around the world. There are many other Apps to purchase for your needs, such as Maps, Local restaurants, Traffic, Weather, GPS, Local attractions and more- but all these come with the high price of an internet plan, a broadband dongle and price of the App.<br /><br />There is also a Text Friendly subscription based service that lets you dictate and send text messages using Asteroid controls, but all at another separate price. If you have unlimited cash, this Parrot Asteroid Android-powered Car Stereo may be for you. But as for it's Apps performance itself, the start up can be slow, it needs reboots like a computer, and sometimes it freezes.

"I've owned/used this product very frequently for 5-6 months, at time of review. I haven't seen too many other headsets specifically similar to this one in scope of features and how they are incorporated. (I did recently see a 99% same make for about $30 less on Amazon)<br /><br />IMO, overall- it works well for general use, but there are improvements that would make it better.<br /><br />Used for mostly YT listening including music (wireless) and wired (mic'd) mobile communications (had to purchase an adapter in my case).<br /><br />Works seemingly well- no BT pairing issues across Win & iOS. I haven't noticed transmission latency.<br />I've only charged it 3-4 times since purchase. (I don't burn through endless hours of wireless listening.) It would be nice if the charging cable was much longer.<br /><br />The mic does not come with a cover (ppl tend to lose them anyhow). It's fully positional- just bend it.<br /><br />It's very well padded. Clamping force and overall comfort feel average for a sub $100 consumer grade product.<br /><br />The ear cups are Round, and small in diameter. Could be larger. I don't feel too much problem with thin-framed glasses due to the padding. Besides the padding, no internal touching to my ears. It's a folding unit- more adjustable and conforming, but high annoying having to straighten it out before use-even just setting it down, the earcups tend to fully swivel backwards.<br /><br />Sound, IMO, is average. At a very high volume, it seems to have more bass.<br /><br />The inline controller is basic. Switched mute, tiny volume dial, and tiny play/pause button. In same cases I've dropped calls because the button was accidently pressed, so easily.<br /><br />You can NOT use the mic in wireless mode.<br />This is a right-sided unit.<br />The mode/volume buttons built into the earcup could be a lot more tactile.<br />Wireless on/off requires a long press/hold. LED indicators lights are excessively bright and the blinking is very annoying in darkness, especially if you don't want to disturb others. I put translucent tape over it.<br /><br />Does come with a bag and some accessory connectors.<br /><br />PROBLEMS:<br /><br />The braided fabric jacketed mic cable rubs against your buddy and annoying transfers that as noise to your earcup and it is annoying AF. I resolved this by covering the cable above the inline controller with vinyl tubing (but why should I have to do that). The cable is a bit stiff and tends towards coiling/kinking.<br /><br />If the 3.5mm TRS connector is not FULLY inserted (and I mean just 1/16"" of an inch loose which is not highly obvious) the in-line mute will NOT work. This has been a repeated problem in my experience and very frustrating, having to check for this kind of silliness. I'm not even sure if that's always been the case. I do not trust it and will be trying another headset because of this. That's a significant issue if you are on mute during a call/chat/what-ever and it's not actually muted because the connection is ever-slightly loose. (This would not be a issue if the mic worked in wireless mode.)<br /><br />IMO, overall- it works well for general use and that's what I would recommend it for.",3.0,ive ownedused this product very frequently for months at time of review i havent seen too many other headsets specifically similar to this one in scope of features and how they are incorporated i did recently see a same make for about less on amazonbr br imo overall it works well for general use but there are improvements that would make it betterbr br used for mostly yt listening including music wireless and wired micd mobile communications had to purchase an adapter in my casebr br works seemingly well no bt pairing issues across win ios i havent noticed transmission latencybr ive only charged it times since purchase i dont burn through endless hours of wireless listening it would be nice if the charging cable was much longerbr br the mic does not come with a cover ppl tend to lose them anyhow its fully positional just bend itbr br its very well padded clamping force and overall comfort feel average for a sub consumer grade productbr br the ear cups are round and small in diameter could be larger i dont feel too much problem with thinframed glasses due to the padding besides the padding no internal touching to my ears its a folding unit more adjustable and conforming but high annoying having to straighten it out before useeven just setting it down the earcups tend to fully swivel backwardsbr br sound imo is average at a very high volume it seems to have more bassbr br the inline controller is basic switched mute tiny volume dial and tiny playpause button in same cases ive dropped calls because the button was accidently pressed so easilybr br you can not use the mic in wireless modebr this is a rightsided unitbr the modevolume buttons built into the earcup could be a lot more tactilebr wireless onoff requires a long presshold led indicators lights are excessively bright and the blinking is very annoying in darkness especially if you dont want to disturb others i put translucent tape over itbr br does come with a bag and some accessory connectorsbr br problemsbr br the braided fabric jacketed mic cable rubs against your buddy and annoying transfers that as noise to your earcup and it is annoying af i resolved this by covering the cable above the inline controller with vinyl tubing but why should i have to do that the cable is a bit stiff and tends towards coilingkinkingbr br if the mm trs connector is not fully inserted and i mean just of an inch loose which is not highly obvious the inline mute will not work this has been a repeated problem in my experience and very frustrating having to check for this kind of silliness im not even sure if thats always been the case i do not trust it and will be trying another headset because of this thats a significant issue if you are on mute during a callchatwhatever and its not actually muted because the connection is everslightly loose this would not be a issue if the mic worked in wireless modebr br imo overall it works well for general use and thats what i would recommend it for,2973

"The Rosewill RX304 USB HDD enclosure that I received works, but the tray design is really quite awful. I'm not going to return it, but the next time I buy a 3.5 inch HDD USB enclosure I will look elsewhere.<br /><br />I own both the Thermaltake Max 5G (USB3) & Max 4 (USB2) HDD enclosures. I also have worked with one of the Sabrent ""fan-ed"" USB HDD enclosures. I cannot remember if it was USB 2 or 3.<br /><br />The Sabrent enclosure was pretty good, other than the fact that the enclosure box ""slid around"" in its stand (the part that contacts the table/shelf).<br /><br />The Thermaltake enclosures are the best and most everything about them is top notch. Unfortunately, Thermaltake no longer manufactures this sort of enclosure. They do still make BlacX USB docks. Those are docks, not enclosures.<br /><br />Rosewill RX304 USB HDD enclosure<br />------------------------------------------<br /><br />First come the complaints.<br /><br />Rosewill provided incorrect HDD screws/bolts. When working with PCs there are normally only 2 types of screws/bolts = coarse thread and fine thread. HDDs take coarse thread screws. The 4 screws the Rosewill provided looked like coarse thread screws, but they wouldn't go into my HDDs more then a couple of turns. I threw them out and used my own screws.<br /><br />At this point I have tried 3 different 3.5 inch HDDs with the Rosewill RX304 enclosure and none of the HDDs were able to become fully seated within the HDD tray. By fully seated I mean that all 4 HDD screw holes line up with the screw holes of the HDD tray. I was never able to get more than 2 screws in. I used WD and Seagate HDDs.<br /><br />But before trying to align the screw holes you have to get the HDD into the tray in the 1st place. THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO because the tray (at the top) is ever so slightly narrower then the HDD that is going into it. WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot??? I guess that I should try bending the tray wall outwards to make it permanently wider. As a buyer I'm supposed to doing this kind of BS maneuver? This is a very bad joke ... and it is on me. If I bend the tray wall outwards will I break something?<br /><br />The mechanical engineer that designed this tray is going to hell when they die.<br /><br />OK. So now the HDD is in the tray (with only 2 screws) and the SATA cables are attached. The SATA cable attachments are a whole other mediocre story, but they can be made to work, so we will continue.<br /><br />One (or more) reviewer/s suggested that the air passage that remains after seating the HDD is not wide enough for decent air flow to the fan and then out of the case. I could be wrong, but I suspect that there is is just enough space for reasonable air flow.<br /><br />Second comes the reasonably good part.<br /><br />Once the HDD is in the tray and the tray (plus interface board) is reinserted into the enclosure box you can put the end on and attach it with 2 screws. This part of the procedure is OK, but nowhere near top quality. There is an internal rail inside the enclosure box that aligns the HDD/tray/interface board within said box. But, there are only 2 ""keys"" in the frame that go into the rail, so the HDD tray assembly is sorta slip/sliding around in the box until you get it fully inserted, at which time the end edge of the enclosure box mates up with an internal channel in the plastic front end.<br /><br />So now we have the box fully assembled, and we put it in its stand (4 rubber ""nubs"" keep the box from slipping around, nice). We then cable up the enclosure's power and connect the USB 3 to a computer.<br /><br />Once all of the above is done you get pretty good performance. On a 2 TB HDD I was able to read the outside tracks at 200 MB/sec. That's the same performance that I get with that HDD inside a computer cabled directly to the mobo. The USB 3 interface worked well for me.<br /><br />On a slightly down note the program HDDScan could not read the SMART values  through the interface board of the Rosewill RX304, but was able to read the SMART values through the interface board of a 2.5 inch Mediasonic USB 3 enclosure that I also own. Other programs may well be able to ""penetrate"" this USB interface to get SMART data ... who knows.<br /><br />As I said at the start the Rosewill RX304 is OK, but I won't be buying any more of these units.",3.0,the rosewill rx usb hdd enclosure that i received works but the tray design is really quite awful im not going to return it but the next time i buy a inch hdd usb enclosure i will look elsewherebr br i own both the thermaltake max g usb max usb hdd enclosures i also have worked with one of the sabrent faned usb hdd enclosures i cannot remember if it was usb or br br the sabrent enclosure was pretty good other than the fact that the enclosure box slid around in its stand the part that contacts the tableshelfbr br the thermaltake enclosures are the best and most everything about them is top notch unfortunately thermaltake no longer manufactures this sort of enclosure they do still make blacx usb docks those are docks not enclosuresbr br rosewill rx usb hdd enclosurebr br br first come the complaintsbr br rosewill provided incorrect hdd screwsbolts when working with pcs there are normally only types of screwsbolts coarse thread and fine thread hdds take coarse thread screws the screws the rosewill provided looked like coarse thread screws but they wouldnt go into my hdds more then a couple of turns i threw them out and used my own screwsbr br at this point i have tried different inch hdds with the rosewill rx enclosure and none of the hdds were able to become fully seated within the hdd tray by fully seated i mean that all hdd screw holes line up with the screw holes of the hdd tray i was never able to get more than screws in i used wd and seagate hddsbr br but before trying to align the screw holes you have to get the hdd into the tray in the st place this is very difficult to do because the tray at the top is ever so slightly narrower then the hdd that is going into it whiskeytangofoxtrot i guess that i should try bending the tray wall outwards to make it permanently wider as a buyer im supposed to doing this kind of bs maneuver this is a very bad joke and it is on me if i bend the tray wall outwards will i break somethingbr br the mechanical engineer that designed this tray is going to hell when they diebr br ok so now the hdd is in the tray with only screws and the sata cables are attached the sata cable attachments are a whole other mediocre story but they can be made to work so we will continuebr br one or more reviewers suggested that the air passage that remains after seating the hdd is not wide enough for decent air flow to the fan and then out of the case i could be wrong but i suspect that there is is just enough space for reasonable air flowbr br second comes the reasonably good partbr br once the hdd is in the tray and the tray plus interface board is reinserted into the enclosure box you can put the end on and attach it with screws this part of the procedure is ok but nowhere near top quality there is an internal rail inside the enclosure box that aligns the hddtrayinterface board within said box but there are only keys in the frame that go into the rail so the hdd tray assembly is sorta slipsliding around in the box until you get it fully inserted at which time the end edge of the enclosure box mates up with an internal channel in the plastic front endbr br so now we have the box fully assembled and we put it in its stand rubber nubs keep the box from slipping around nice we then cable up the enclosures power and connect the usb to a computerbr br once all of the above is done you get pretty good performance on a tb hdd i was able to read the outside tracks at mbsec thats the same performance that i get with that hdd inside a computer cabled directly to the mobo the usb interface worked well for mebr br on a slightly down note the program hddscan could not read the smart values through the interface board of the rosewill rx but was able to read the smart values through the interface board of a inch mediasonic usb enclosure that i also own other programs may well be able to penetrate this usb interface to get smart data who knowsbr br as i said at the start the rosewill rx is ok but i wont be buying any more of these units,4007

"The GOOD:<br />These work well for hearing dialog and hushed speaking, or when it's accompanied with a lot of background noise in certain movies and tv shows.  Also work well if someone is hard-of-hearing, so that you don't have to crank up the volume on the tv (the volume of each headset is individually adjustable).  We've found it also works well if one person watching tv while others in the room are playing games or watching something else on their tablets.<br />The BAD:<br />These are extremely Line-Of-Sight.  The base unit has to be aimed directly where you're seated, and if you're sitting just a couple/few feet to either side, you'll start getting more & more static.  If I stand up to grab something from the other side of the room, the static will overtake the tv audio dialog completely and I have to take them off my head.

"The case is nice and has good positions for airflow.<br /><br />PRO: Full wrap around areas for fans.<br />  Clips for the three external drives and two internal drives<br />  Add-on plastic mount for 2-2.5-inch drives. It relocates if you put a side fan in.<br /><br />CONS:  Not enough BLACK fan screws to add more. I used the ONE SET for one top fan.  All others I had to use metal colored ones.<br />  Only two sets of HDD ""clips.""  The other drives require screw mounting (screws included).  A cheap shot.<br />  DISREGARD the mounting point letters embossed in the case.  Your board doesn't need all of them.  Line it up and decide.<br />  NOT ENOUGH standoff legs if you had to locate them everywhere they say.  You would need extras from previous installs.<br />  As usual, the printed instructions suck!!  Their desire to do it in a myriad of languages caused them to make VERY SMALL print.  Even then, it is just what the places are--no details!!<br /><br />There is plenty of room in the case!!  Routing cables out of the way is no problem.  Even with my power supply that has four 12V cables.  A few tabs with holes to use the included zip ties would be nice!! A small pack of stick on cable router tabs ($2-3) solves that.<br /><br />Update 10-30-2013:<br />The HDDs are a very tight slide in and out.  So I took two clips off the other side and used them on two more drives.  Since they are not being pushed (like a DVD or card reader), one clip holds them well.  For the faint of heart, you can put one screw on the other side of the rack, but that defeats the whole purpose.<br /><br />Hint: the top fan mounts have a filter screen. Since top fans blow out (or should!), there is no reason to filter air coming out of the case.  Since you want a positive pressure, I only put one fan in and slowed it down with a controller.  NOTE: If you are mounting a fan horizontally like that, use a ball bearing fan.  A sleeve bearing fan will get noisy and wear faster in that position.<br /><br />Since the rear top fan position sits right above my CPU cooler, I blocked that fan port using 3M 1080 I had left over from a car project. CPU fans blow ONTO the CPU, so I didn't want to take air from that.  The top filter will be cut down and used on other intake fans. Cheaper than buying a filter.  Another problem I found with that top filter was the fan was putting almost as much air down as it was out. Self defeating!! Once the filter was removed it works as it should.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend the case for those used to doing builds.  First timers may find it frustrating.  Especially the header cables.<br /><br />Just 1/2-inch taller, and leaving the MB ports where they are, would keep a top fan from interfering with installing my RAM cooler fans.

"I use tablet to hold sheet music in my music classes. This stand does work somewhat with both my 10"" and 12"" tablets. Unfortunately, stability is iffy. The legs are metal, but the joints between the segments are not very solid, so it does sway back and forth somewhat. The top swivel piece does not have any solid mechanism so that part is especially wobbly.<br /><br />I mount my tablet in vertical portrait mode and that tablet holder only grips the tablet from the sides, not the top and bottom like it would in landscape mode. There is no locking mechanism on the tablet holder, only spring tension, so you have to really trust the springs to hold your tablet in place. I do not know if they will get looser with age. 12 inch tablets can be heavy, as well as very expensive.<br /><br />This stand does come with a carrying bag, which is great for carrying to class.

"I've been considering what star rating that I should give these softboxes, alternating between 2 and 3 stars. I settled on 3 stars. They do not fit my needs. Plus the storage bag has about the same strength as a paper bag. And there are no instructions for setting them up. But the skirt material seems to be of a high quality.<br /><br />Since 1974, I have always used umbrellas. But I have never used softboxes. Over the years I have known friends who have loved their softboxes. I have been out of the professional photography business for many years, but I sometimes still break out the equipment for a temporary studio setup. I recently decided to give these softboxes a try, and I just received 2 of these softboxes.<br /><br />My 1st impression is that you do not setup these softboxes up for a temporary shoot. You set them up and leave them up. Moving them around to temporary locations would be problematic.This is the main reason why I only gave them 3 stars.

"I bought these to mount my Samsung rear surround speakers that have a keyhole mount. Unfortunately this bracket (nor the speakers) come with a proper way to connect the two. I ended up having to go to Lowe's to get a screw and bolt that both fits into the keyhole, yet is short enough that it doesn't interfere with the ball rotating mechanism. The holes in the mounting brackets are not threaded so they could have included more screws that fit a wider array of products it there.  In any case, it is a tight fit after getting the screw/bolt in place and then inserting the speaker wire. In the end, I got it all together and it works, but this could have been a five star review if they would just include a couple more screws and bolts for mounting options. It was a hassle to set up, where it should have been a five minute install.

"This is a great deal on outdoor cameras.  They are easy to set up and work well with the software you can download.  They are sturdy and compact.  I got them to replace some cameras that are around our barn so we can see the horses, and the only surprise was that they didn't pan.  The other cameras were able to move up and down, right and left so that I could see where the horses are.<br />I was going to give them 4 stars, but then I realized it was my issue.  The description never said they would pan and I just missed that.<br />So, if you want remote cameras and don't mind that they are stationary, this is a great deal.  You get three cameras for $160.  However, if you look at the current description, one camera is $49.99, so you can buy three individual cameras for slightly less than the 3 pack.  Goofy, but that's sometimes the case.<br />UPDATE:  I also noticed that the speaker on the camera, so I can talk to whoever is there, has such a low volume it cannot be heard over 1 foot away.  Not very helpful for a remore camera.  I sent in a request to their support team asking if there is a volume control on the camera or the mobile app.  They responded with a request for the model number, which is fine, and then didn't reply to my response for over a month.  Their next reply was to ask a bunch of questions about firmware and app permissions, which was not helpful.  This indicates to me there is a problem with support and also possibly a problem with the deveopment group.  Any retail product should have a features list somewhere, maybe not available to the public, but certainly available to the support team.  That feature list should indicate if there is a way to control the volume.  Rather than taking a month to ask additional, irrelevant questions, the support people should have either looked at the feature list or asked the developers if there is a way to increase the volume.<br />That did not happen, and so I'm reducing the rating to 3 stars.  All products can have problems and the test of a good product is having a support group that can quickly and accurately respond to the problem (or question), and that is not the case with Merkury.<br />Since I planed to install this about 6 feet off the ground, the camera is of limited value.  It doesn't pan, which was my issue, and no one can hear what is said through the app, which is their issue.  Support is not helpful so I don't know if this is a problem with the camera or a feature they left our or a feature they intend to include later.

"When someone who already had a Kindle Fire for 2.5 years buys another Fire, and returns it, you know something is wrong.<br />You know it is not because they don't like Fire tablets, because they bought a second one.<br />You really know it is not because they don't know how to use a Fire tablet.<br />(Well, something else is wrong too: the first Fire should have lasted AT LEAST three years. But no, the 10"" tablet USB micro B connector went really bad long before it should have. So I bought another one! Even though we all know planned obsolescence is a poor reason to buy anything.)<br /><br />I got extremely rare good luck: I got an intelligent technician who witnessed by screen-sharing how both tablets worked.<br />(Most of the time you will get someone to whom you describe the settings you changed and how they performed, who says, ""Now go up to the top right corner where it says ""Sign In"".)<br /><br />(1)<br />a) I like to use landscape mode. On my old tablet, when an app works only in portrait mode opened, as soon as I closed that app, my entire tablet went back to landscape mode, just the way I had set it.<br />b) On my new tablet, when I opened an app that used only portrait mode, when I closed it, my entire tablet's settings were hijacked and set into portrait mode.<br />I had to set it, cycling through, to ""auto-rotate"", then to ""landscape"". . . Every. Single. Time.<br />If you have my usual luck, you will reach a technician who just thinks you aren't bright enough to set your own settings. I got lucky and the good tech witnessed the hijacking of my settings. And saw that the old tablet did not do that!<br /><br />(2)<br />a) I used my old tablet for 2.5 years (should have lasted for 3 years) to order more stuff from amz than I can remember. Of *course* I was able to choose which address, which payment method, which delivery window I wanted each time.<br />b) The new tablet app wouldn't let me choose payment method or delivery speed. You could poke holes in the screen jabbing at it, to no avail.<br /><br />(3) For an 8"" Plus, with 3Gb memory instead of my old 2 Gb, it was awfully slow. I have never watched a tablet wake up and show only the titles of all the icons on the home page, and mosey around taking its good old time waking up before the icons themselves showed up. It was slow in other ways too.<br /><br />(4) I had a micro SD card in my old Fire the whole time. I didn't save all those files just to have them locked away from me forever. I put the card in my new 8 Plus, and that thing wanted to format it! No freaking way!<br /><br />Now if an Apple or maybe a Windows machine, or maybe my Linux laptop, couldn't read it, I would think, okay, different operating systems. But another Kindle Fire?? Really???<br /><br />I appreciate the really excellent service the technician gave me. Really, it is the first time I have had assistance that good. Yeah, we know how to go to the upper right and sign in on the yellow button. Sheeesh. And I also know how good it is to find someone who doesn’t assume that you don't know how to use your own settings.<br /><br />But after they got back to me (I told you it was good service) and said that ""Software engineering is working on it"", hoo boy. I knew it wasn't going to be another few days, and someone would just flip an account setting switch and voila! all better now.<br />I knew I was in it for the long haul.<br /><br />At that point, it was ""I'm returning this, and I'll come back when the New And Improved Kindle Fire doesn't work far worse than my old Kindle Fire.""<br />It's supposed to be, you know, better.<br /><br />But this could take a while.

"I have so many feelings about this watch. First off, set up was a breeze. You just open your app store and get the Google app directed. Pairing and synching up your info is very easy. The watch is very beautiful! I was scared the crystals would rub right off like glitter, but I have not had any issues so far. Now for all the bad stuff.. first and foremost the battery life is terrible. I would give it 9-10 hours max. I'm not much of an app person either, so if you are then that means your battery life will be even lower. It has its own charger, so that means you'll have to carry it around with you, especially big your planning to go out after work or school which is very inconvenient. I with it was a standard C USB charger so I can just use my phone charger, but sadly that's not the case. I did an experiment to see how long the battery would last. I charged it to 100%, and left it in my desk right before bed. In the morning at 8 am, I am at 15%. Whoa. Yeah, the battery is just really really terrible. So I thought I'd just change the battery settings..well there is only one other option and that is to go into battery saving mode where all it will display is the time. That in my opinion defeats the purpose of a smart watch. Other than that, I love how I can customize watch faces by using my social media, or pick from a pre made list by Michael Kors. You can also get email notifications, download apps like Google keep to take notes by speaking into your watch, as well as use Google pay, activity tracker, weather, and pause and play music without taking out your phone. So yeah, if your okay with a short battery life, then everything else about this watch is awesome. Just giving you the real tea.

"Cell phone cords aren’t indestructible and devices only include x1 at purchase.. so it’s safe to say you need an extra or two! With a family of 6- I’ve bought more than my share and found a “life hack” to help preserve cord life.. Bear with me and I’ll explain!<br /><br />Most travel with a cord, use x1 in a car and even keep a back up for when x1 is lost or fails. Purchasing an extra set of x3 can prolong the life of original cord.. In leaving “original” stationed where phone charges and is most often used (overnite testing place!) it won’t see excess bend, tweak, creases etc. expediting the cords demise! Using “add-on” set in allows a permanent cord in vehicle, x1 for travel and x1 extra fail safe!! *Trust me- this system works!<br /><br />This set looks every part the original cord. No “hot spot” in cord nor phone battery while using. Also haven’t received the maddening “not compatible” error text?! Using with iPhone 8+ it can go from 10 to 90% plus in approx. 90-120 min. (if using while charging it’s slower.) All ends snug without wiggle.. everything feels as it should and at a price point under $20 for x3- its doing the job.<br /><br />What I don’t see: nothing feels reinforced! No connecting reinforced end or ‘extra’ substance.. End feels pliable so, I expect they’ll crease if used with pressure in the 90° “death angle!” Exterior isn’t overly robust.. not braided or thicker casing. It will let you wind/store easy.. but, not offer added protection.<br /><br />Does it work- so far, so good! It lacks the “extra” to combat or reinforce the weak spots. Best for those who are careful or use with minimal daily wear and tear. Prob not best for a teen backpack or traveling career!!

"Where was StarTech's quality control? Out to lunch?<br /><br />So disappointed as I had high hopes for this rackmount unit. I had a unique need for a side-mounted, wall-mounted 4-post rack. This was the only product I could find that seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately, quality control at StarTech appears to be sorely lacking.<br /><br />First off, this is not clear in the product description, but the rack arrives fully assembled in a very large box. This quite surprised me as 99% of the time devices like this are flat-packed and the manufacturer expects the end user to assemble the device. This saves a lot of money on shipping for the manufacturer and reseller. I'll say in retrospect, it would have been better if Startech sold this unit flat-packed as it might have avoided the significant issue I ran into.<br /><br />As it arrives, the parts of the unit are riveted together. They only fit one way. There are no adjustments. This has the disadvantage for all parties whereby when a unit is damaged significantly - as mine was - there is no choice but to return it.<br /><br />It's difficult to tell in the photo showing the full frame, but my entire unit was twisted. It's as if someone built it and then picked it up and mangled it in 3 axes simultaneously. I've never seen anything like this with a device that clearly is designed to fit together only one way and feels very sturdy when you pick it up and move it around.<br /><br />The entire unit weighs almost 50 pounds, so it is quite heavy. This is another disadvantage for a wall-mount unit, as it is very awkward to position the unit for installation given its weight and girth. Preferably a 2-person job (perhaps 3). And again, an area where a modular, flat-pack design would have made more sense.<br /><br />My main issue however, was the significant warping of the unit. I had a particular need to install a 4-post device with rails. That meant right away I knew this rack was not going to work. If you only have 2-post equipment installation requirements and receive a twisted rack, you may be willing to live with the inconvenience of a non-square rack unit. However, in my case - and if you are going to install any 4-post equipment, especially with rails - this is going to be a problem. If you're planning to use rails, don't even think about trying it out before you return the unit. Your rails will get twisted and at the very least, over time the strain will warp the rails. No thank you.<br /><br />There was also a significant dent in one corner. Now, I'm not generally picky about defects like that, but first, I had this issue of a warped rack to begin with; and secondly it caused me to wonder if the cause of the warping was someone using this rack like a soccer ball and if it was perhaps thrown around the factory floor after assembly. The dent is pronounced, as if someone hit it with a hammer. It not only defaced the corner, but flattened it. This is a tough rack and seems very sturdy, meaning something really hard must have hit that corner.<br /><br />EDIT 12.05.2021: Upgraded 3 stars after Amazon swapped out my severely warped 1st rack with a 2nd at no charge, and the replacement rack is perfectly square!<br /><br />I do want to warn anyone contemplating installing equipment requiring rails that while this is a 4-post rack, the rackmount screw holes (squares) are recessed about 1/2"" into the rack frame. Thus, some rail supports are just a tad too wide to work with this rack (ask me how I know... lol).<br /><br />With a typical floor mount or wheeled rack, you're not likely to run into this problem, but since this rack is designed for wall mounting, the vertical sides are reinforced. This is great from a stability perspective (presuming your entire rack is not warped to begin with), but it's not helpful when you intend to install after-market parts such as rack rails. When I installed a set of Rosewill rack rails to mount my RSV-L4500 chassis, after assembling the rail supports and sliders, I discovered the clearance width was short by 1/4"". The culprit turned out to be the fact the Rosewill rail mount ears were pushed inward by 1/8"" on either side, because the edge of the ears is 1/8"" wider than the wrap-around clearance of the rack. It's a bit difficult to visualize from my explanation, but if you take a close look at the business end of the rack face - where you'd attach M6 bolts into your square nuts - you'll see it's not very wide on either side before you hit the edge support of the rack.<br /><br />Note, this also means any unusually wide rack handles also won't fit and you may need extra long M6 bolts if you want them bolted well to keep them in place. At this point, I'm left with a few options, none of which are great: 1) don't use a 4-post rail to support the weight of this beast of a case; 2) hire a metal shop to trim the edge off the rack mounts if there's enough clearance; or 3) let the chassis hang and hope for the best. Third option is a bad idea IMHO considering my chassis will weigh close to 60 lbs. by the time it's filled with HDDs.",3.0,where was startechs quality control out to lunchbr br so disappointed as i had high hopes for this rackmount unit i had a unique need for a sidemounted wallmounted post rack this was the only product i could find that seemed to fit the bill unfortunately quality control at startech appears to be sorely lackingbr br first off this is not clear in the product description but the rack arrives fully assembled in a very large box this quite surprised me as of the time devices like this are flatpacked and the manufacturer expects the end user to assemble the device this saves a lot of money on shipping for the manufacturer and reseller ill say in retrospect it would have been better if startech sold this unit flatpacked as it might have avoided the significant issue i ran intobr br as it arrives the parts of the unit are riveted together they only fit one way there are no adjustments this has the disadvantage for all parties whereby when a unit is damaged significantly as mine was there is no choice but to return itbr br its difficult to tell in the photo showing the full frame but my entire unit was twisted its as if someone built it and then picked it up and mangled it in axes simultaneously ive never seen anything like this with a device that clearly is designed to fit together only one way and feels very sturdy when you pick it up and move it aroundbr br the entire unit weighs almost pounds so it is quite heavy this is another disadvantage for a wallmount unit as it is very awkward to position the unit for installation given its weight and girth preferably a person job perhaps and again an area where a modular flatpack design would have made more sensebr br my main issue however was the significant warping of the unit i had a particular need to install a post device with rails that meant right away i knew this rack was not going to work if you only have post equipment installation requirements and receive a twisted rack you may be willing to live with the inconvenience of a nonsquare rack unit however in my case and if you are going to install any post equipment especially with rails this is going to be a problem if youre planning to use rails dont even think about trying it out before you return the unit your rails will get twisted and at the very least over time the strain will warp the rails no thank youbr br there was also a significant dent in one corner now im not generally picky about defects like that but first i had this issue of a warped rack to begin with and secondly it caused me to wonder if the cause of the warping was someone using this rack like a soccer ball and if it was perhaps thrown around the factory floor after assembly the dent is pronounced as if someone hit it with a hammer it not only defaced the corner but flattened it this is a tough rack and seems very sturdy meaning something really hard must have hit that cornerbr br edit upgraded stars after amazon swapped out my severely warped st rack with a nd at no charge and the replacement rack is perfectly squarebr br i do want to warn anyone contemplating installing equipment requiring rails that while this is a post rack the rackmount screw holes squares are recessed about into the rack frame thus some rail supports are just a tad too wide to work with this rack ask me how i know lolbr br with a typical floor mount or wheeled rack youre not likely to run into this problem but since this rack is designed for wall mounting the vertical sides are reinforced this is great from a stability perspective presuming your entire rack is not warped to begin with but its not helpful when you intend to install aftermarket parts such as rack rails when i installed a set of rosewill rack rails to mount my rsvl chassis after assembling the rail supports and sliders i discovered the clearance width was short by the culprit turned out to be the fact the rosewill rail mount ears were pushed inward by on either side because the edge of the ears is wider than the wraparound clearance of the rack its a bit difficult to visualize from my explanation but if you take a close look at the business end of the rack face where youd attach m bolts into your square nuts youll see its not very wide on either side before you hit the edge support of the rackbr br note this also means any unusually wide rack handles also wont fit and you may need extra long m bolts if you want them bolted well to keep them in place at this point im left with a few options none of which are great dont use a post rail to support the weight of this beast of a case hire a metal shop to trim the edge off the rack mounts if theres enough clearance or let the chassis hang and hope for the best third option is a bad idea imho considering my chassis will weigh close to lbs by the time its filled with hdds,4805

"Most people are raving about this camera because they are using it with their iPhones.<br /><br />But if you don't have an iPhone, keep looking, there are other kits that will be more to your liking.  Because of my lack of an iPhone (oddly, I just got one two days ago, so I may give this another try and then update the review if I like the camera more) I had to use the included link to the executable Windows program.  The program is outdated (like from the days of VCR's and answering machines) and has no documentation.<br /><br />By documentation, I mean there are minimal instructions and no built in help files.  I was able to get it to work by running the software with a lot of finagling and figuring it out by means of hunting around through my past experiences hooking up cameras.<br /><br />All in all, a bit of a disappointment, I was hoping to catch the wankers who keep spraypainting my carport.<br /><br />Update - Still using this with the PC, just a note, you have to leave the PC software running to report. This camera works through an extension cord but not a surge protector.  Not sure of what the range is and at least in our house, it needed to be on the same circuit breaker as the base, but this could just be weird wiring in our house.<br /><br />A nice feature of the camera is a motion detection feature, so you don't end up with hours of blank unmoving street view for example.  For the recording, pretty much continuously, it takes about 2GB per night (this is with camera on from about 9pm to 8am).  There is a way to look at the recorded footage in super fast motion, so it takes about five minutes to watch the entire night's events (use VLC);'oh, hello again, curious kitty who keeps hanging out on my porch.'<br /><br />This is not an outdoor camera, but we are using it outdoors anyways (tried placing it near a window, but glare of light on the window blinded the camera).  I don't have any need to record stuff indoors.

Bought this for my trip to Germany. The price was very attractive for a converter with USB power and three outlets. It works just as advertised and I had no problems using it at any point during the trip. It comes with a nice travel pouch and packs up reasonably small which makes packing it in a backpack very easy. My only complaint is that it is that the fans are noisy and it has a very annoying blue LED light when it's turned on. I will be fixing the LED light with some nail polish soon but I'm still not sure what to do about the fan noise.,3.0,bought this for my trip to germany the price was very attractive for a converter with usb power and three outlets it works just as advertised and i had no problems using it at any point during the trip it comes with a nice travel pouch and packs up reasonably small which makes packing it in a backpack very easy my only complaint is that it is that the fans are noisy and it has a very annoying blue led light when its turned on i will be fixing the led light with some nail polish soon but im still not sure what to do about the fan noise,540
"This reversing ring works well.  I suggest first attaching it to your camera body and then threading the lens (lightly!) to the ring.  While it is made well and out of aluminum they could have, should have, spent a little more care with the threads that screw into the lens.  Be careful to not over tighten the ring onto your lens.<br /><br />Once attached, the lens (18-55) felt quite securely attached to my camera body (5200).  When removing the lens you should unscrew the lens from the ring and then remove the ring from the camera body.  If the ring is over tightened on the lens then the threads of the ring deform slightly (I believe) because the lens is made from a stronger material than this ring.  I believe this condition is called galling. Galling can result in the two pieces ""friction welded"" together.  Easily avoided if you just use care and not over tighten the ring on the lens.<br /><br />Don't forget to purchase an aperture control ring for the other end of your lens if it does not have a manual aperture control on it.<br />You will also need to set your camera to manual as none of the automatic features of the lens will work and the camera may even report that there is no lens attached.<br /><br />I would recommend this as an economical option to the Nikon BR2, unless you can afford the $30 difference in price between the two.",3.0,this reversing ring works well i suggest first attaching it to your camera body and then threading the lens lightly to the ring while it is made well and out of aluminum they could have should have spent a little more care with the threads that screw into the lens be careful to not over tighten the ring onto your lensbr br once attached the lens felt quite securely attached to my camera body when removing the lens you should unscrew the lens from the ring and then remove the ring from the camera body if the ring is over tightened on the lens then the threads of the ring deform slightly i believe because the lens is made from a stronger material than this ring i believe this condition is called galling galling can result in the two pieces friction welded together easily avoided if you just use care and not over tighten the ring on the lensbr br dont forget to purchase an aperture control ring for the other end of your lens if it does not have a manual aperture control on itbr you will also need to set your camera to manual as none of the automatic features of the lens will work and the camera may even report that there is no lens attachedbr br i would recommend this as an economical option to the nikon br unless you can afford the difference in price between the two,1285

The support person barely spoke any english and had absolutely no technical knowledge of the product.  Even after I had explained that I went through all of the troubleshooting steps, she had me go through them again.....3 more times!  Hard resetting the access point 6 times isn't going to fix the issue...smh.<br />She then told me that Amazon had to exchange the product even though I bought it 5 months ago.  Huh?

"I just got the new iPad a couple of weeks ago, and both of my in-laws have this case on their iPads (I think she has a 1st gen and his is 2nd gen). It seemed like a good idea, so I ordered one as well. Here is my opinion.<br /><br />Pros: fits well, sturdy cover keeps iPad safe, built-in keyboard connects very easily (just press a button!), keyboard seemed to have good battery life.<br /><br />Cons: Stands at an awkward angle (nearly 90 degrees), keyboard cannot be detached, keyboard in way when lying open and flat on surface, no way to keep the cover shut when it's in a bag/purse, no protection between keyboard and iPad screen, included keyboard charger requires something with USB port to charge (either a desktop or a USB AC adapter)<br /><br />Now, I don't know if it was the particular keyboard I received or if this is a more general problem, but when I would try to use the keyboard to type, it seemed like the response time/Bluetooth connectivity was extremely sloooooooow. So it would end up either I mistyped something and didn't know it because I was long gone on to the next paragraph, or things would eeenndd uupppp looooookiiing likkee thiiss. :)It also just flat-out didn't respond to my keystrokes sometimes. That plus all the little gripes I had mentioned above all combined to make it a deal-breaker. I was also slightly annoyed to find, when I removed the cover to return it to Amazon, that it had created some black staining on my ridiculously-priced ($35) HD screen protective film. The black won't come off, either. It's not too bad, and it's only along the sides where it doesn't impede my view of anything on-screen, but my iPad is white, so it's pretty noticeable. And I JUST bought the screen protector, so I don't plan on replacing it for a while. Would I have noticed if I always kept the iPad in this case? No, but it's annoying that since it now isn't, I can see the black smear.<br /><br />And honestly, I don't type as much on my iPad as some people might, so I decided I don't really need a keyboard, anyway.

"I bought this to give my laptop protection during travel. It does that. It also gives me space to possibly put the iPad in the pocket along with the laptop.<br /><br />Because of that, when you only have A 2021 MacBook Pro, it’s not held tight in the case. It’s slightly rattles around. But the surfaces are padded and I think it’ll be fine.<br /><br />The case only opens 90°. So that could be a problem for some people that want to open their laptop farther if you were going to use it in the case. Also the gussets that hold it at the 90° mark tend to get stuck inside your laptop if you close them both at the same time. Not a big deal. The shoulder strap loops are large ballistic nylon and may not fit some shoulder strap attachments.

"This is my first foray into a larger monitor.  I expected everything to be bigger.  Not so.  I zoom the page to 150% and it helps, but when I exit out of a site, I have to zoom the next site also.  This gets tiresome.  I'm sure there's something I'm missing - some setting I should be fixing - but I just installed this today, and am not particularly computer savvy.  Also, the blue ""on"" light at the front bottom of the monitor is much too bright.  VERY distracting.  Like a blue sun, staring at me.  I have to admit the colors are good.  Blacks are black.  I like the fact it tilts.  But, I wanted to be able to see bigger pictures, bigger print. All this does well is give me lots more blank space to look at - while the print and pictures on the page are the same size as they were on my small monitor.  It just stretches the page out.

"I ended up using this colorimeter to profile and calibrate my monitor. Out of the box I was not very happy with the quality of the product. You end up getting pretty much zero instruction and no manual. I had to figure it out on my own just by looking at the product. Once that annoyance was over I got to experience how terrible the default software from datacolor is.<br /><br />I looked to the reviews and decided I could make the most of this purchase by using other free calibration software.

I calibrated and it seemed to do a decent job. All in all, the calibration software looked like it was powerful--certainly better than the default.<br /><br />In the end, I returned the product.

"Image quality is OK but didn't provide the kind of clarity that I was hoping for and have experienced on larger screens (I'd used 27"" 1440p monitors before -- both TN panels and IPS -- and was excited to try out a 24""). This monitor can get the job done, though I see what people mean now when they say it's difficult to really take advantage of QHD while gaming on 24"".<br /><br />On the unit I received, the screen was defective (vertical line down the middle that made it look like a permanent screen tear). This monitor was advertised as ""renewed"" and ""professionally checked"" for ""no visual cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm's length.""<br /><br />I think some of these people bank of buyers being too worried about the hassle of returning products that they (sellers) aren't bothered to take the time to ensure are quality-controlled. No one should be receiving defective units that they pay so much money for.<br /><br />Edit (2020-10-27):<br /><br />After trying to update my seller feedback for 6ave, reflecting on my experience with them, I couldn't figure out a way to edit so I deleted it (believing that I'd be able to simply resubmit). Since now my feedback for the seller 6ave is no longer there, and I cannot resubmit, I figured it wouldn't hurt to add some notes in this product review (which I've left at 3 stars, as I originally submitted).<br /><br />Here is what I originally wrote for my seller feedback:<br /><br />""The seller got the monitor to me one day early, which I really appreciated; however, the screen was broken (as soon as I booted up my game, I noticed a vertical line down the middle that made it look like a permanent screen tear). You should not be sending someone a defective unit that they pay so much money for.""<br /><br />Here is what I'm writing now:<br /><br />6ave's customer service contacted me by email shortly after I sent in that feedback, and they're initial response apologized for the issue, asserted that the item must have gotten damaged during transit, offered me ""an additional $15 refund for the inconvenience,"" and included this: ""We would also appreciate the removal of feedback as this package was damaged during transit by carrier.""<br /><br />This company tried to buy back a review, and they did so knowing that the $15 ""additional"" refund was nowhere near the $79 restocking fee that Amazon customer service ultimately confirmed that 6ave charged me during the total refund process. I only found out about the restock fee from Amazon and after I'd already refused to accept a buyout for my original review. I'd informed the 6ave customer service rep that I would gladly update my seller feedback once they simply processed my returned item and returned to me my money -- and that rep still pressed in follow-up emails and on our phone call for me to remove the review and to allow them to provide me this extra $15.<br /><br />While all of my exchanges with 6ave were taking place, the rep never informed me of the restock fee (though she insisted on me receiving my full refund once Amazon process it, along with the $15 ""additional"" that 6ave wanted to gift me) and I was not aware that you could not edit reviews (the rep also didn't correct/inform me that editing reviews was not possible; she knew full well that their aim was simply to remove any negative feedback existing).<br /><br />This company sent me a defective product, tried to bribe me with $15, and then charged me $79 dollars to ""restock"" their product which was broken upon arrival.<br /><br />If I could resubmit the seller feedback, it would be 1 star for deceptive and shady practices.

Once would have been an error on my part but it happened multiple times on that trip. I just came back from Churchill Canada and the same exact thing happened at least five or six times.

Would be okay for a laptop.<br />  Testing shows the drive (Samsung 840 EVO is SATA 6GB) is SATA III capable; the enclosure is only SATA II.<br />  Does NOT transfer at USB 3.0 rates.<br /><br />Ability to add a 5V external supply would be nice.  The plug to the enclosure is simply a USB mini, so it is questionable of there is a true 900mA going to the box.<br /><br />The box does not mention SATA anything.  There was NO paperwork, documentation, warranty or anything inside the box.<br /><br />This shows up (with several different testing packages) as ""ADPlus SuperVer USB device.""

"Picture is nice,<br /><br />The real reason I'm sending the units (I've had two) back, however, is that the player refuses to output the various high quality audio formats, including 7.1 DTS Master Audio. The digital coax cable barely works and the HDMI 2 audio output simply does not work, Admittedly I have an older receiver -- a Sony STR-DA5400ES, from 2009. But it has multiple HDMI inputs and the HDMI 2 audio output on the X800 is specifically designed to send audio to an older amp. Even Sony phone support says it should work. But it doesn't.. I spent 1 hour and 7 minutes with Sony ES support today going through every possible menu permutation on both the Amp and the UBP-X800 player. No luck The HDMI is dead. Zero output. The coax output can only send DTS EX 5.1, even though the player itself tells me it's playing DTS Master Audio 7.1.<br /><br />This UBP-X800 has two HDMI outputs: one for video, one for audio. In case you don't have a 4K receiver with the ever-changing HDMI protocols, you're supposed to be able to feed HDMI audio to the amp. So I fed the video directly to the Samsung's video input (a direct cable connection) and another HDMI to my amp.<br /><br />Zero audio from the player's HDMI audio feed. Not a peep of audio at all.<br /><br />So I used the orange RCA digital audio coax connector to get surround sound audio.<br /><br />But the coax digital audio cable only delivers DTS EX 5.1, not the 7.1 DTS Master Audio available on the Kingsman 4K disk. I updated the player's and the TV's firmware and read the manual. Nothing fixes the problem. Using all new, very short, high-speed HDMI 2.0 cables too.<br /><br />My ancient Sony BDP-S560 Blu-ray player feeds all formats to the same 5400ES amp properly. I get great 7.1 DTS Master HD audio. Thus my old Blu-ray player sounds way better than my brand new advanced Sony UHD player.<br />Researching at the Sony forum under the UBP-X800 Audio Problems thread, answers were all over the place and none worked, I tried to register so I could post my problem and the website wouldn't allow me to. The comments there were complaining that they could not get the ATMOS tracks working.<br /><br />I have no choice but to pack both X800s up and send them back.<br /><br />Eventually I found that I needed to plug the 4K player into input 3 of the TV for the image to stabilize. Interesting that only some inputs on the TV can handle UHD source. But still, the player's audio doesn't work with my Sony Amp (Sony's fault).<br /><br />HDMI was supposed to solve all these problems, but I suspect the HDCP copy protection schemes are really screwing things up or the firmware has bugs or companies just produce inferior products.

"Trust me, this is not everything they say it is. the voice controls are beyond terrible. If you ask it to move left or right, it goes two or three in that direction. You end up needing do math to figure out how many jumps back and forth it takes to get to where you want. You will only use the remote because the rest of the functions are so frustrating. Also it suddenly thinks you are asking it something when nothing resembling Alexa has been said, so in the middle of your movie or show it just jumps to Wikipedia for no reason whatsoever. Seems to have way harder time doing things than my echo dots do. Final straw and reason for only one star  is they recently starting running ads during the screen saver.

"I've had a RAID-5 array running with four of these Spinpoint F3 (HD103SJ) drives running since 2010. Over the past four years, I've had to replace SIX of these drives. That's right, I've owned a total of NINE of these, and I've replaced ALL of the original four.<br /><br />Last year, I decided to stop wasting money on these and decided to just pay a little more for a different drive (WD Black), and today I'm running with three of the Samsung drives and one WD Black. Guess what? Two days ago, one of the remaining Samsung F3s started reporting a SMART failure. I ordered a replacement, and just today - TWO days after that Samsung F3 drive reported the SMART failure, a second Samsung F3 started reporting SMART failures, too.<br /><br />So today, I've got three Spinpoint F3 drives left, two of which are about to die. That means in four years, I will have had 8 out of 9 of these drives die.

"You could say I work for a small business.  Four guys in an office.  We actually work for a large company, but have a small local office and requested a server because corporate access was too slow over VPN to work on.  To save 300 bucks, they got this.<br /><br />Well, if you are a small business owner, forget about this thing.  There really aren't any pros, other than the small form factor and relatively inexpensive cost.  But you get what you pay for.  And to be clear, I wouldn't buy this for my house, either.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1) Google this thing.  It is NOTORIOUSLY slow.  And disaster recovery is not guaranteed if a disk is lost, or the controller goes bad.<br />3) The USB port is essentially useless.  In order to utilize it, you have to mount the drive and format it with the XFS file system.  So if you thought you were going to put backups on it, and then be able to read from your computer in an simple way, think again.  (it has to use its own power supply too, can't use a small portable hard disk).  Apparently there may be some third party options for reading this file system...but this was supposed to be ""easy"" right?<br />4) The XFS file system does not allow read-only or hidden attributes (among other things I am sure it doesn't do.)  So anything you copy to this blasts these attributes away.  So for a small business Windows implementation, this is horrible.  I alsopresume the XFS to NTFS system conversion overhead is a main driving factor in the slowness of this unit.<br />5) Security policies are clunky.  Supposedly there is a way to get this linked up.  Not sure, but we really have no control over file access at this point.  Our IT guys couldn't get it to properly NETBIOS with our network to assigned it a useable, logical name, so we access it via static IP, and no security policies.<br />6) We have this on a gigabit switch with cat6 networking.  IT IS SLOOOOOOOWW!  Google this.  We also get ""network busy"" errors periodically.  Around 10 MB/s is max.  Expect no more.  Maybe good enough to stream music, maybe movies, for a home user.  Want to transfer a few Gigs around?  Forget it.  My USB 2 drives are faster than that.  So I don't know where the f$*# these marketing sleezes came up with 72MB/s.  Maybe they meant 72Mb/s?  Big difference, guys.<br /><br />If you are a Windows user, my opinion is to build a small computer, put a small OS drive and two hard drives in it, and run synctoy a few times a day to mirror the date b/t the large hard drives for redundancy.  Networking is simple, so are fileshares and security policies, as well as all of the familiar windows file attributes and plug and play ease.  Forget RAID, and forget this thing.

"To say I'm disappointed is a gross understatement.  If I could give this product zero stars, I would.  First, the aesthetic is awful.  The sophisticated texture of the MacBook Air is covered by a shiny - SPARKLY - sticker.  It's not a subtle sparkle. Think Evil Kineviel's motorcycle helmet sparkly silver.  Yeah, it's bad.  Next the trackpad barely worked to the touch.  Honestly, I threw it away.  When the product costs what it does, it's hardly worth going to the effort to send it back.

I immediately called  Customer Service to ask why this was happening?

The only solution for me was to have all my friends contact their carriers and ask them to unblock my number.  Ridiculous!!!!

"I would love to give this iPod model a fat five stars, but I can't bring myself to do it. The problems I have had with this product far out number the times I've actually had some enjoyment out of it. Here is what I've learned (on my 3rd iPod)<br /><br />Pros: This model holds a massive amount of songs, which means never having to delete/upload different songs you want to play. The user interface is also easy to navigate.<br /><br />Cons: If you are a Mac user, you probably love this product. However, as a Windows user, I find that the compatability issues are horrendous. I've experience, intermittent uploading, computer freezing, iPod crashes. If you own a PC, get used to seeing exclamation points on your iPod screen. And in these cases, 99% of the time the iPod will not restore.  The battery life is also very poor; you can expect to see a significant decrease in performance within the first six months of purchase. Now that I'm on my 3 iPod and my warranty is about up, I will shortly be stuck with a expensive piece of junk. Apple suggests using the 5 R's to get your iPod back on track: reset, retry, restart, reinstall, restore. These are ineffective 95% of the time so I've suggested so more helpful tips:<br /><br />Reuse: Makes a nice coffee coaster or Christmas tree ornament.<br /><br />Recycle: Better than in a landfill, right?<br /><br />Resuscitate: Compressions on any part of the click wheel are  generally more effective than what Apple suggests.<br /><br />Rock it: iPods are well-known for having more sound come out of the malfunctioning unit, than out of the headphones.<br /><br />Ruin it: Bury it in a deep hole so you won't be reminded of how much how spent on a worthless toy.<br /><br />Good luck!",1.0,i would love to give this ipod model a fat five stars but i cant bring myself to do it the problems i have had with this product far out number the times ive actually had some enjoyment out of it here is what ive learned on my rd ipodbr br pros this model holds a massive amount of songs which means never having to deleteupload different songs you want to play the user interface is also easy to navigatebr br cons if you are a mac user you probably love this product however as a windows user i find that the compatability issues are horrendous ive experience intermittent uploading computer freezing ipod crashes if you own a pc get used to seeing exclamation points on your ipod screen and in these cases of the time the ipod will not restore the battery life is also very poor you can expect to see a significant decrease in performance within the first six months of purchase now that im on my ipod and my warranty is about up i will shortly be stuck with a expensive piece of junk apple suggests using the rs to get your ipod back on track reset retry restart reinstall restore these are ineffective of the time so ive suggested so more helpful tipsbr br reuse makes a nice coffee coaster or christmas tree ornamentbr br recycle better than in a landfill rightbr br resuscitate compressions on any part of the click wheel are generally more effective than what apple suggestsbr br rock it ipods are wellknown for having more sound come out of the malfunctioning unit than out of the headphonesbr br ruin it bury it in a deep hole so you wont be reminded of how much how spent on a worthless toybr br good luck,1616

"So after many failed attempts to link with Amazon I'm making a review. The app leaves much to be desired it's total trash. I have tried linking my account via laptop etc doesn't work.<br /><br />Motion activation may work... But with the exception of 1-2x it hasn't notified me if people are by the door. The doorbell function does work as intended, however I bought this to link with Amazon and alexa so it can notify me via my echo show /studio /dot devices around the house also.<br /><br />Next we have the subject of the subscription fee. It's per device, which means if you have the 5 cameras and the doorbell your paying a lot per month. Why the hell is it not an account based system that you set up an account pay 20$ a month and you can have unlimited devices? These things don't work without wifi so if the power goes out they are useless as a security system.<br /><br />My suggestion for people is buy a standalone camera setup with recorder. You can even set most up for remote login via your phone, several are internet connected and can notify you if there's motion. Sure some are more expensive but don't think for a minute this is cheap vs those. What those cost up front this will rack up in the long term with subscription fees.

"Update: I have changed my 5-star review to a 1-star. This unit just stopped working; it wouldn't read a battery at all. I don't know how the ones I've given to family and friends are holding up, but this unit is dead. Quite frustrating. I won't be buying any more of this type of battery tester.<br /><br />I've lost count of how many I've bought and shared with friends and family.  Since my first purchase years ago, I've considered this little tester to be an essential tool in my tool box. The tester itself has no batteries. It has contact points that you line up with a battery's contact points. The digital display shows you the volts the battery has. Or doesn't have—a completely dead battery doesn't register anything, so all you see is a blank screen. You'll also get a blank-screen display if the contacts aren't lined up correctly. This tool has saved me money by showing me which batteries still have a full charge and which need to be discarded. I've used it for all sizes of the ""button"" batteries, 9-volt batteries, and for sizes AAAA to D flashlight-type batteries.<br /><br />It's also highly effective in getting rid of guests who don't know when to go home. Pull out the battery tester and a container of batteries, and say ""Hey, guys, want to see something cool??"" Then proceed to test each battery, enthusing over the reading and making sure each person gets to see the tiny screen for themselves.

"So we set this up about a month ago and followed the instructions perfectly. It's very easy to set up. The wires are color coded for you in fact. We turned it on to watch a movie and then out of nowhere it shut itself off. We turned it back on again, and a few minutes later it shut itself off again. It's done this repeatedly. Some times it only takes a few minutes, while other times it'll stay on for a good hour or longer before shutting itself off. Obviously there is no auto shut off feature if it does it inconsistently. If it shut off every hour, then I'd know it must be timed, but it's not. It's random as to when it decides to shut off. And no, our unit doesn't get overheated or anything. It's got good ventilation and when I touch it I never feel heat.<br /><br />Another problem we've encountered is when the sound just stops. The screen stays up, but the sound just stops whenever it wants. And no, it's not too loud. I keep it at a reasonable volume at only 15 or 20 (not high at all). This has happened repeatedly as well.<br /><br />One night we got so sick of it that we just unplugged it and tossed it in the dumpster outside our apartment. We were that fed up with it.

"I got this cable thinking I could replace the Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter that I had been using for a few months now on my Mid 2012 MBP to go directly to my Asus 24 inch monitor.  I never had any issues with this setup, I just wanted to leave the adapter on the HDMI cord to my TV in the living room so I would not have to remember the adapter every time I wanted to watch a movie on the big screen.<br /><br />I plugged this cable in, and immediately noticed a ton of pixelation/artifacting in shadows/dark areas in movies.  Knowing that Apple has had issues with this I went to the forums and followed what other people reported as fixes for this.  After resetting my NVRAM,SMC I was hoping that the issue would be rectified but it was not.  Wondering then if this was an issue with the Thunderbolt port on my MBP I borrowed my wife'd MBA (Mid 2011) and still had the same results.  I also tried a different (Samsung) monitor and had the same results.  At this point, I knew it was not the monitors or my MBP/MBA so I put the old Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter back in place and the pixelation/artifacting was gone, blacks and whites were their stunning blacks and whites as they had always been.<br /><br />This is not the first time I have had a &#34;Cable Matters&#34; display cable be junk when I got it, the DisplayPort to DVI-D adapter I got a while back was junk too, I just scratched that up to the crappy company laptop I was using at the time.

"I can't tell you if the Garmin product is good or not.  This ""Refurbished"" item was worthless.  It worked when I received it, and I was able to download Birdseye imagery for a backpacking trip.  Then, the morning I was leaving for my trip, the refurbished unit wouldn't turn on.  I tried three different sets of batteries and various USB cables -- nothing.  It wouldn't even blink.  I had to leave on my trip with it not turning on.  It never turned on since.<br /><br />I've seen through hikers on the PCT with similar devices (been hiking the Sierra since before GPS myself).  I would have counted on this for a risky trip deep beyond the wilderness boundary in a flyover state.

Now I'm unlikely to try any Garmin/DeLorme product out of fear for the same result.<br /><br />For the brief period that it did work, this navigator seemed to have a fine GPS function.  The maps were underwhelming.  While I'm ok with just basic 24K USGS topo maps, the detail available on Keyhole (Google Maps/Earth) is far better.  The Garmin unit seems to just use Open Street Maps and is missing most of the labels for National Forest service roads.  A lot of the roads are just totally missing.

"I'll start with the good.  And this would have been my review if I had done this earlier.  The sound is great.  Crisp highs, pretty low lows.  Quite comfortable.  Really lightweight.  And also has a removable wire (plug on both ends).  And also a pretty good price.  Everything was leading to a perfect review.  I made up my mind that I should not review anything until after 1 year with the product.  And with these headphones, they never made it.  May 2019 will make a year.  I took my headphones off.  Went to the bathroom.  Came back, put my headphones on.  And the Right side ear-cup broke off.  Now over the year I have dropped my headphones off my desk, 2.5 feet, twice.  But that was 2 or 3 months ago.  And it broke now?  I think somebody skimped out, and chose a cheaper construction material.  Because a lower grade of plastic would save a penny.  They are good headphones, IF you treat them with kid gloves.  I wanted to come back and add to this review, but I forgot all about it.  The depth of the ear-cup on these headphones is unacceptable to me.  My ears are stick out a bit more I guess.  I finally got a (beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO)  It is great.  Think about how many ohms you want.  Because it come in a lot of flavors from 80 to 250.  higher ohm make for deeper base, true.  But you also have to have a bigger amp to drive them.  Or you will have a set of headphones that only go up to 1 decibel.  I have the 80 and they are like others on volume, and nice deep base.  I'm happy.  The Audio-Technica are overpriced and under quality.  For a little bit more money you can be happy with the  beyerdynamic.  And I've dropped them and they hit the floor soft, it the way they are designed.  A hit will cause them to fold in and absorb the shock.  No thud.  If you keep them free of water.  You could give them to your grand-kids.  I got some Marshall stuff from a gramdpa.  Err, I didn't, it was my friend.  This stuff will be good like that.  Marshall had their day, and it is over.

It looks great and is an cool case if you want protection or you broke your kick stand like my so did. The only problem is that this case traps heat.

It could be due to the fact that the kickstand is covered. There needs to be more ventilation towards the back. Its really tight so the screen protects don't fit so well with the case.

The rubber foot can fall off easily and get lost, leaving you with an aluminum ball with a spike sticking out.<br />4. It's too long even at its shortest length.<br />5. For its high cost, it has no ability to angle the camera on top. You have to add a tilt head like a 3232 or ball head to make this work.<br />6. No convenient way to carry it when not needed.

Slick looking, enough ports, widely enough spaced for bulky plugs.

Got excited to try this inexpensive security camera.  But my excitement turned into panic.<br /><br />I tried to download and install the app.  During the install process got curious and tap on one of the option that seems available.  My phone went crazy and started to do weird thing.  Turned it off and when I turned it back on - my screen turned into a magnified object.  Now I got alarmed.  I tried everything and could not get it back to normal.<br /><br />Aside from shutdown/power off.  I tried to find a way for a hard reset.  Fortunately a search online showed how to do a hard reset on my phone.<br /><br />Got it back and deleted the apps that seems half-installed on my phone.  This product is useless without the apps.  I wished all security camera standardized on Amazon Alexa to make things easier.

"I purchased the brownish cover in October 2011, it was delivered in December. One month ago, August 2012, the light went out. I was always very careful and never once dropped it.  I was reading when the light just went out. I called Amazon to see about the warranty and they said there was only a 1 month warranty and there is nothing they can do. Just my luck that it didn't break within a mere 30 days of purchasing it. They were very generous in offering to ship me a new one at full price and give me a deal on the shipping. I obviously declined as I can't afford to buy a new one every 8 months.

"I bought this to ""upgrade"" from my original DTSE9 (USB 2.0) 16GB flash drive that I've been using for 4-5 years. When I plug it into a Windows computer, it works fine. Yet, I plug it into a MAC computer and it makes the whole machine run slow. I tested this on several MAC computers in my organization (including personally owned machines) and it messes with the USB bus. Unfortunately I need it to work on both. It's sad because I like the higher copy speed of 3.0, but if it slows up the host OS on a MAC, it's essentially useless to me.<br /><br />For what it was worth, just in case folks ask, YES, I did try formatting it in different ways. Even on the MAC I did it using it's journaled format. Tried NTFS (even though can write back to it on a MAC). Tried all different block ranges, FAT32, eXFAT, etc. eXfAT was the slowest. Seemed like the drive liked FAT32 a little better than NTFS on Windows machines.<br /><br />From what I've read, many people are stating the drive randomly dies. I don't know if there is a rhyme or reason behind why it messes with the bus on a MAC, but it might be a clue as to poor engineering. I have a feeling there is a component on the board that is prone to failure. What it is, I won't know, because I'm not taking apart a somewhat working flash drive. If it dies, then I will, and I will be certain to reverse engineer it and report back the findings.<br /><br />I bought a 64 GB DTSE9 2.0 a while back and kept it in my desk, I am just going to revert to that or just got back to the 16 gigger. It's too bad because it really was an upgrade in terms of read speed (not so much in the write speed department), but most of my work involves read.<br /><br />I also noticed the durability of it is just garbage. They used thinner aluminum that the original. I took a picture. The one on the left is the new one after a month of use, and the right is the older version with ~4-5 years of use almost every day. The new one had a dent on the bottom after the 1st week. I'd call that unacceptable.<br /><br />Unfortunately there aren't a lot of companies that make durable flash drives that are encased in metal and are small. I was looking at the Samsung one, and it is just too big. Even this one is a little on the long side.<br /><br />I was considering returning it, but for one, I put somewhat sensitive data on it, and second, it got dented. I wasn't going to abuse Amazon's return policy, even though the product is junk and NOT comparable to their original version. Lastly, it still is usable, but I will just use it at home or as a backup for ""fun"" stuff. But not rely on it.<br /><br />Overall, waste of money -- not worth it. Durability is rubbish. Total lost cause.<br /><br />Bottom line -- I do NOT recommend buying this flash drive.",1.0,i bought this to upgrade from my original dtse usb gb flash drive that ive been using for years when i plug it into a windows computer it works fine yet i plug it into a mac computer and it makes the whole machine run slow i tested this on several mac computers in my organization including personally owned machines and it messes with the usb bus unfortunately i need it to work on both its sad because i like the higher copy speed of but if it slows up the host os on a mac its essentially useless to mebr br for what it was worth just in case folks ask yes i did try formatting it in different ways even on the mac i did it using its journaled format tried ntfs even though can write back to it on a mac tried all different block ranges fat exfat etc exfat was the slowest seemed like the drive liked fat a little better than ntfs on windows machinesbr br from what ive read many people are stating the drive randomly dies i dont know if there is a rhyme or reason behind why it messes with the bus on a mac but it might be a clue as to poor engineering i have a feeling there is a component on the board that is prone to failure what it is i wont know because im not taking apart a somewhat working flash drive if it dies then i will and i will be certain to reverse engineer it and report back the findingsbr br i bought a gb dtse a while back and kept it in my desk i am just going to revert to that or just got back to the gigger its too bad because it really was an upgrade in terms of read speed not so much in the write speed department but most of my work involves readbr br i also noticed the durability of it is just garbage they used thinner aluminum that the original i took a picture the one on the left is the new one after a month of use and the right is the older version with years of use almost every day the new one had a dent on the bottom after the st week id call that unacceptablebr br unfortunately there arent a lot of companies that make durable flash drives that are encased in metal and are small i was looking at the samsung one and it is just too big even this one is a little on the long sidebr br i was considering returning it but for one i put somewhat sensitive data on it and second it got dented i wasnt going to abuse amazons return policy even though the product is junk and not comparable to their original version lastly it still is usable but i will just use it at home or as a backup for fun stuff but not rely on itbr br overall waste of money not worth it durability is rubbish total lost causebr br bottom line i do not recommend buying this flash drive,2602

"Definitely falls into the category of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. This Intel Core i3-based laptop is astonishingly, agonizingly slow. I bought this to replace a 7 year-old MacBook Pro that had served well, but didn't have the horsepower to run the latest version of OS X. This Acer is only marginally faster than the MacBook, and feels slower in may respects. It's glacially sluggish to start-up or restart, and Excel and Word crawl along at speeds reminiscent of 1980s era PCs. Browser speeds - Chrome, IE, and the execrable Edge - all range from stagnant to plodding.<br /><br />Other, more minor, negatives: the track pad might as well be 50 shades of gray, because it requires an extremely firm touch.

They called me less than 24 hours after the case was opened (another big plus), but they had my laptop registered to someone else and I had to call them back when I had the laptop in front of me. The person I spoke with had me shutdown the laptop, and use a utility to reset system configurations to the default. When I restarted the computer, the performance had not improved. The support person commented that the laptop only has 4 GB of memory, which apparently makes it unsuited to running Excel. Acer sold the computer with this configuration, and no mention of not being able to run the MS Office suite (or open more than one tab on a browser). He then suggested wiping the computer and resetting it to the original state. I'm not willing to invest any more time in this laptop.

"I bought this protection plan for my gold iPhone 6 plus and had to use their service for the first time when I got a cracked screen. I called them, paid $60, and received a new phone (it was silver not gold!) and sent back my old phone. Everything seemed fine for almost a month when I realized the phone has a problem with the microphone. People could not hear my voice clearly when I talked via the phone. BTW I had not dropped the phone nor anything bad happened to the phone during this time. So I called again and had to pay another $60 because it was more than a month now. Received a new phone and had to ship the old phone and reset everything on my phone for the second time. Very frustrating but still OK. Now the screen on this new phone started flashing on and off and obviously not usable. This time I called immediately not to miss the 1-month period to send it back. So I went through all that hassle again but still though maybe I am just too unlucky!! BUT here is the worst part! I realized the phone took slightly blurry pictures but I did not want to go through that hassle again, besides I had an oversees travel ahead so I could not handle the problem before I leave. I though I may be able to fix it in a store when I come back (no apple store where I was going). My travel took longer than I originally planned (about 2 months). When I came back, after a couple weeks and absolutely suddenly (without anything wrong happening to the phone), the phone completely shut down and never turned on again!!!!!! I called Squaretrade (willing to pay another $60 although there was definitely something wrong with the phone they sent me) and this is when I realized my 2-year contract has ended. So they just said sorry and you should have called earlier!!! So I ended up paying about $300 to buy the plan, paying $120 for two claims and a completely dead iPhone 6+. I certainly am not going to use their service again. I recommend all my family and friends against this plan and I would certainly make sure I leave my feedback for people out there and warn them. The phones this company are sending are certainly NOT like-new phones as they claim.

"I bought these on impulse because 1) they were Klipsch, 2) they were ""noise isolating"" and 3) they were on sale. $30. Sorry to say they aren't worth half that.<br /><br />They are NOT noise canceling. They are noise ""isolating"" because they are the ear bud design that seals into the ear canal, like millions of other ear buds. Nothing special. Any descent set of silicon earbuds will do the same noise isolation.<br /><br />I knew in 30 seconds these earbuds lacked any low end. No bass at all. The specs say they go down to 12 Hz. Hah. No way. The music is simply not full and rich. The highs are excellent, but with no bass, the music is really thin.<br /><br />I'm amazed how many reviews say how nice the music is. My throwaway Creative earbuds are much fuller and more sensitive.<br /><br />With the S3's I have to turn the volume up more and there's still no bass. I would consider this somewhat dangerous. You crank up the volume to get more bass and you burn your ears out with the excessive treble.<br /><br />I tried all three sizes of earbuds, too, just to see if it was a sealing problem. But no matter which size earbud I tried, the music sucked.<br /><br />I tried all the EQ settings on my iPhone 4. None added any noticeable bass. Maybe it's an impedance mismatch<br /><br />This concerns me about other things Klipsch.<br /><br />I did like the way you can turn them upside down and drape the wires over you ears to hold them in place for running, but I didn't actually try them before putting them away. Might work. Might not. My initial feeling with any of the bud sizes is that they tended to fall out of my ears.<br /><br />Strangely, the buds that came with an old Creative MP3 player are far superior.<br /><br />If I had paid the full $49 for these things I would be really upset.",1.0,i bought these on impulse because they were klipsch they were noise isolating and they were on sale sorry to say they arent worth half thatbr br they are not noise canceling they are noise isolating because they are the ear bud design that seals into the ear canal like millions of other ear buds nothing special any descent set of silicon earbuds will do the same noise isolationbr br i knew in seconds these earbuds lacked any low end no bass at all the specs say they go down to hz hah no way the music is simply not full and rich the highs are excellent but with no bass the music is really thinbr br im amazed how many reviews say how nice the music is my throwaway creative earbuds are much fuller and more sensitivebr br with the ss i have to turn the volume up more and theres still no bass i would consider this somewhat dangerous you crank up the volume to get more bass and you burn your ears out with the excessive treblebr br i tried all three sizes of earbuds too just to see if it was a sealing problem but no matter which size earbud i tried the music suckedbr br i tried all the eq settings on my iphone none added any noticeable bass maybe its an impedance mismatchbr br this concerns me about other things klipschbr br i did like the way you can turn them upside down and drape the wires over you ears to hold them in place for running but i didnt actually try them before putting them away might work might not my initial feeling with any of the bud sizes is that they tended to fall out of my earsbr br strangely the buds that came with an old creative mp player are far superiorbr br if i had paid the full for these things i would be really upset,1669

"I got this after purchasing a Fire TV. I was excited at the idea to sync it up and be able to have the sound play from my soundbar and the Dot. However, this did not work right. Not only can you not sync up the dot and soundbar at the same time because one is bluetooth/wired and one is wifi and neither support doing both... but also Alexa as a personal assistant is terrible in general. The speech recognition is hit or miss. I will tell it to switch to Xbox and it will bring up some random channel. I'll say to play something on Pandora and it will say I haven't connected an account for YouTube etc. It's very frustrating coming from a Google Home Mini to this.

"I bought this card thinking ""its made by ASUS, so the quality cant be that bad, can it?""<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. Go check out Hardware Unboxed review of this card on Youtube for details, he perfectly sums up the problems with this card. I thought there was something fishy when this card dropped, and NOBODY had a proper detailed review of the card in the first week.<br /><br />At stock settings, the fans dont spin very fast when maxed (stock has max fan speed at 40%), and the card will easily start overheating and thermal throttling within 5-10 minutes of gaming, even less if you use a powervirus, like furmark as a testing tool. Even if you go and manually tune the fans to spin faster, it will STILL OVERHEAT.<br /><br />Fan speed past 60% will sound like you have a vacuum cleaner in your case, it is annoying to have them run at over 50%.<br /><br />If you take apart the card, you will notice that the GDDR6 mem heatsink is a pathetically worthless thing, it is completely unable to properly cool the memory, so you will continually have your memory overheat and thermally throttle. From my testing, if you dont crank those fans so loud that you can hear them through headphones, it will continually microstutter, trying to keep itself from literally frying itself to death. THE GDDR6 COOLING IS EVEN WORSE ON THE 5700 NON-XT VERSION! THERE ISNT EVEN A HEATSINK AT ALL! The die temps I was getting were uncomfortably warm, getting to just over 90C at times, and the mem temps were continually hovering around 100-105C or more after 10 min of Furmark with stock config. I tried with increasing the max fan speed to 60%... I was still hitting 100+C on the mem, with the GPU getting to about 85C. FYI, the forced throttling temp for memory is usually set at 100-105C, with GPU max temp usually about the same. You can mitigate the problem by either manually opening up the card, and installing extra thermal pads and attaching a heatsink ontop of the heatsink (yo dawg, I heard you like heatsinks...), or severely undervolting and underclocking the card, while cranking up the fans (which defeats the purpose of getting a non-reference 5700XT).<br /><br />THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS MODEL IS SO CHEAP, EVEN COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE 5700XT, IT IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT BY DESIGN.<br /><br />Asus has refused to address the shoddily designed product of theirs, insisting that there is no problem. Congratulations Asus, I will NEVER buy a TUF series of video card from you again. Your TUF team has destroyed the reputation you built up with me in the past.<br /><br />I replaced the Asus TUF 5700XT with a Powercolor Red Devil 5700XT... the difference is night and day. Stock config temps when running at 100% after hours of gaming are 75C GPU and 80C Mem.<br /><br />If you are looking for a 5700XT, the best bang for your buck is the Gigabyte OC, the Sapphire Pulse is also a solid choice, if you want to spend a bit more, the best primo versions are the Powercolor Red Devil, and the Sapphire Nitro+.

The manual is also easy to follow.<br /><br />The only thing that I wish was better was the stand it comes with. It’s really thin and the monitor will fall down if it’s moved even a little.

"This cover is HARD GLUED to the back of the iPad. I started having issues with my new iPad, also bought from Amazon,  almost immediately - the thumbprint did not work, crazy banner ads would appear from the right when swiping page by page on the Kindle app, wifi was hard to keep alive, hard to find, and would never accept wifi password.  When the iPad could not connect to the hot spot on my iPhone, I was ready to return it to Apple. But first I thought I should take the cover off JUST TO BE SURE there were no issues.  And the cover would not come off - my husband had to work to 1+ hour to get it off with the scraper used for clay pot cooking, and there is still residue on the back.  I am very sad Amazon cannot be trusted to offer accessories that don't damage the product they are being purchased to protect.  I doubt Apple would take a return on the iPad as there are now signs of glue on the back, which they would consider to be  damage.",1.0,this cover is hard glued to the back of the ipad i started having issues with my new ipad also bought from amazon almost immediately the thumbprint did not work crazy banner ads would appear from the right when swiping page by page on the kindle app wifi was hard to keep alive hard to find and would never accept wifi password when the ipad could not connect to the hot spot on my iphone i was ready to return it to apple but first i thought i should take the cover off just to be sure there were no issues and the cover would not come off my husband had to work to hour to get it off with the scraper used for clay pot cooking and there is still residue on the back i am very sad amazon cannot be trusted to offer accessories that dont damage the product they are being purchased to protect i doubt apple would take a return on the ipad as there are now signs of glue on the back which they would consider to be damage,920

"I bought this watch 18 months ago and posted a positive review.  However, I have changed my review because I found out the watch is not water proof.  After swimming for about 30 minutes in a shallow pool, the watch stopped working.  The screen was unreadable and the watch froze at the Garmin logo. I found a you tube DIY repair video where an owner who had the same experience showed how to pop open the case and use CRC electronic cleaner to wash out the water residue and restore functionality to the watch. Following the instructions in the video, I fixed the watch and it is now working.  Although I was able to repair the watch, it is clearly not waterproof.

"I purchased this IP Camera to replace a Trendnet Internet Camera that a customer of mine had been using for several years.  The old camera had many drawbacks, but it was cheap and did the job.  The application is allowing members at a tennis club to monitor the courts to see if they are dry or wet and if all the courts are in use.  Note that I am a very technical person, so this should have been a 10 minute install.<br /><br />After spending several days trying to setup this IP Camera per the instructions that came with it and trying to use the online customer support, I finally called the support line.  According to Trendnet customer support people that I spoke with on the telephone:<br /><br />1) Couldn't get the camera to work viewing the courts as sunlight would completely wash out the picture.  After a back and forth with the email support people learned that you had to update to the latest firmware to set the camera environment to ""Outdoor"".  After doing that, the camera could handle the light, but the colors were way off: black was purple, some greens were black, everything was off. According to support, this camera is intended only for inside use,  that is why the colors are off.  In testing we found that the colors are off inside as well as outside no matter what setting you select.  On the box there are pictures showing outdoor scenes with perfect color, a baby with really nice pink skin, etc..  None of these pictures could possibly be from this IP Camera.<br /><br />2) This camera requires authorization and is a ""closed"" system.  There is no way to utilize it as an open webcam.<br />In further testing we found that support of MS IE8 is poor and they apparently never tested with Safari.  By utilizing Firefox and switching the rendering engine to IE all features work.  The only way to get a consistent image is to use JPEG. The software has script errors that appear in loading on IE8 and if a guest user clicks on any selections on the left side it crashes.<br /><br />More observations after using the camera for several days:<br /><br />Error messages are in broken English:<br />  IP Camera has been reboot, please wait for 0 seconds ...<br />Inaccurate error messages:<br />""This browser doesn't support or disable Java JRE .""  (Firefox browser with latest JRE installed and enabled)<br /><br />If you click on the wrong area, the Trendnet script breaks and takes down the browser.<br /><br />Imaging is acceptable at 640x480 as long as you don't need accurate colors. Has 16x digital zoom that is useless past 4x due to pixalization, and zooming will freeze the browser if you go all the way to 16x.  JPEG imaging won't work in IE8 at all. MPEG imaging only works in IE rendering engine as requires ActiveX component, but fails repeatedly under IE8.  MPEG imaging works in Firefox if you select alternate rendering engine (IE).  JPEG imaging works in Firefox and Chrome, but still crashes if wrong area selected.  Support claimed wasn't their fault as they ""didn't write the software.""  Excuse me, who is selling and delivering this product?<br /><br />When I took the still picture attached, it froze the main screen and I had to shut down the browser to recover - really bad behavior on the part of the application.  Poor code writing is evident throughout.<br /><br />None of the shortcomings are documented in the Trendnet Datasheet (inside use only, authorization required.)  Just the opposite, you would believe that the camera can be used for almost any application AND they offer an outside enclosure for the camera.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product to anyone.",1.0,i purchased this ip camera to replace a trendnet internet camera that a customer of mine had been using for several years the old camera had many drawbacks but it was cheap and did the job the application is allowing members at a tennis club to monitor the courts to see if they are dry or wet and if all the courts are in use note that i am a very technical person so this should have been a minute installbr br after spending several days trying to setup this ip camera per the instructions that came with it and trying to use the online customer support i finally called the support line according to trendnet customer support people that i spoke with on the telephonebr br couldnt get the camera to work viewing the courts as sunlight would completely wash out the picture after a back and forth with the email support people learned that you had to update to the latest firmware to set the camera environment to outdoor after doing that the camera could handle the light but the colors were way off black was purple some greens were black everything was off according to support this camera is intended only for inside use that is why the colors are off in testing we found that the colors are off inside as well as outside no matter what setting you select on the box there are pictures showing outdoor scenes with perfect color a baby with really nice pink skin etc none of these pictures could possibly be from this ip camerabr br this camera requires authorization and is a closed system there is no way to utilize it as an open webcambr in further testing we found that support of ms ie is poor and they apparently never tested with safari by utilizing firefox and switching the rendering engine to ie all features work the only way to get a consistent image is to use jpeg the software has script errors that appear in loading on ie and if a guest user clicks on any selections on the left side it crashesbr br more observations after using the camera for several daysbr br error messages are in broken englishbr ip camera has been reboot please wait for seconds br inaccurate error messagesbr this browser doesnt support or disable java jre firefox browser with latest jre installed and enabledbr br if you click on the wrong area the trendnet script breaks and takes down the browserbr br imaging is acceptable at x as long as you dont need accurate colors has x digital zoom that is useless past x due to pixalization and zooming will freeze the browser if you go all the way to x jpeg imaging wont work in ie at all mpeg imaging only works in ie rendering engine as requires activex component but fails repeatedly under ie mpeg imaging works in firefox if you select alternate rendering engine ie jpeg imaging works in firefox and chrome but still crashes if wrong area selected support claimed wasnt their fault as they didnt write the software excuse me who is selling and delivering this productbr br when i took the still picture attached it froze the main screen and i had to shut down the browser to recover really bad behavior on the part of the application poor code writing is evident throughoutbr br none of the shortcomings are documented in the trendnet datasheet inside use only authorization required just the opposite you would believe that the camera can be used for almost any application and they offer an outside enclosure for the camerabr br i cannot recommend this product to anyone,3418

Samsung has done everything they could to make this a great phone. But, Android is a cumbersome beast. This phone goes from 100% to 50% battery charge in a heartbeat and then the power saving kicks in, and it seems to work more efficiently but you've already lost half of your charge.  It's confusing to the point of madness and Android is filled with bugs too numerous to list. I have had all kinds of strange issues and Google offers no support whatsoever. So, I had to deal with any problems that came up and there were a ton.  I recently got an iPhone 5 and it is everything I hoped Anrdoid would be.

"The water resistance of this watch is pathetic. I went into one of those small swimming pools about 3ft deep. I didn't do anything crazy. When I got out, I noticed the watch wasn't working. Upon investigation I saw that water was inside the watch, which could be seen from the back of the watch where the heart rate monitor is. Looking at the specs, Samsung states a water resistance rating of 30 minutes at no more 1 meter which is about 3ft 3 inches. Simply unacceptable considering the price I paid for the watch. It is a fitness watch, I should be able to swim all day with it if I want to! If a  $20 cheap watch can be waterproof to 50m, why can't this $100+ watch do the same. I am completely unsatisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />The other downside to this watch is the watch band is not made well. It is only held on by two studs, and there is no band loop, so the watch can come loose. You better be prepared to spend a few bucks and buy one, or you will lose this device!<br /><br />Aside from that, if you promise not to get it wet, it is pretty accurate in counting my steps. Connected to my phone great. If I turned off the bluethooth, and synched it up once a day the battery lasted 5-7 days. A lot shorter with the bluetooth always on.

I purchased my first one in October 2010.  The volume control was funky and sometimes worked right and other times worked in reverse.  It was weird and then it totally failed.  The quality of the output when I could get it to work was great though.  So I purchased a second one a month ago and it came from the factory with the volume control totally inoperable.  I would be very careful of purchasing this unit because I have read on Amazon reviews many people have had woes with the volume control.  I am not happy with the problems.,1.0,i purchased my first one in october the volume control was funky and sometimes worked right and other times worked in reverse it was weird and then it totally failed the quality of the output when i could get it to work was great though so i purchased a second one a month ago and it came from the factory with the volume control totally inoperable i would be very careful of purchasing this unit because i have read on amazon reviews many people have had woes with the volume control i am not happy with the problems,517

"When the speaker works, it’s great. Unfortunately, however, these speakers are ticking time bombs. After a few months, the speaker will stop working. At that point, you’ll email the owner of the company — Patrick Clancy — and he’ll respond with a generic email telling you to hold down the home button for 8 seconds. That will not solve the problem, and you’ll tell Patrick as much. Patrick will send you a replacement speaker, and all will appear well. Unfortunately, though, through normal use, that speaker will also break down in a couple months. You’ll email Patrick back, and after some delay, he’ll send you another replacement speaker.

"I've only had this laptop for a year and a half. It's given me problems before, but recently I had to take it in to get professionally fixed. Apparently windows had a bad update or something, and I spent $125 fixing it. A week later the same problems I was having previously showed back up again. Now my trackpad isn't working. In fact, when I go into devices and drivers, it doesn't say there's a trackpad at all. There's nothing for me to try to update. Why would my laptop get rid of my trackpad? All I did was put it to sleep overnight! The only way to use it now is to plug in a mouse. I tried downloading the trackpad drivers-- no luck. I tried a system restore and it won't do the restore. So now I'll have to take it in to get fixed again for another couple hundred dollars. I spent almost $1000 on this piece of junk and I do NOTHING that would cause problems on a basic laptop. I use Word, upload photos, and surf the internet and social media. I do not game and I do not go on porn sites or anything sketchy. I don't download random files from the internet. I have virus protection and malware. Never again, HP!<br />Update: When I updated the BIOS driver, I would get my trackpad mouse back. This happened multiple times--and every time nothing worked except updating that already updated BIOS driver. Even the guys at the repair shop didn't know that something like that would ""fix"" it.<br />Update 6/5/2019: It's been less than two years since I bought this laptop. I have never mistreated it--never slammed the lid, never dropped it, nothing. But last weekend when I opened the lid I heard a ""pop"" and found a shard of plastic on my desk. One of the hinges became misaligned somehow, and then I could neither close it nor open it further without the outside backing of the lid forcefully separating from the screen. I shut it down real quick, and then was able to maneuver the lid and the hinge enough to get it closed. I was on a work trip when this happened, and luckily I was able to get by without using my laptop again until I came home. I was able to carefully open again and it seems to be working, but I will not attempt to close it again. I'll do an extra backup and I will probably use it (if it lasts) until August when my MS Office and Bitdefender subscriptions run out, then I'll have to shell out for a new laptop.

"I bought these at the same time as a Steiner 7x50 Marine model.  The Commander XP's use the same case but for triple the price have better eyepieces, coatings and optical specifications and a few additional or better accessories than the Marine model.<br /><br />I compared them in terrestrial and celestial viewing but the easiest comparison is done with astronomical subjects since they really define performance clearly.  The images in the Marine model merged effortless.  In the Commander XP, I have difficulty merging the images.  They're obviously badly out of collimation.  I don't care to fix this myself on binos in this price range.<br /><br />I evaluated the real and apparent fields of view as well as the sharpness near the edge of the field.<br /><br />In the Marine model, the real field of view is reasonably wide but apparent field is quite narrow.  It's not bad but it's not a spectacular vista either.  In the Commander XP, the real FOV is only barely perceptibly wider. Steiner's website lists the specifications.  The apparent field is about the same.  The almost indiscernable extra width of real FOV does not contribute much to the value for triple the price.<br /><br />On the Marine model, I put Sirius and Jupiter in the center of the field.  They look nice.  Moving the binoculars so that the objects were farther from the center of the field I could see the image degraded about half-way to the edge of the field of view.  Near the very edge, the image was appalling.  Much more than half-way out of the center of the field of view, the star or planet turns from a bright point to just a smear.  Near the very edge it's a dim smudge.  I tried the same with the Commander XP.  It was every bit as bad.<br /><br />Are the XP's better on dim objects?  The optics are supposed to transmit 96% light compared to the Commander V's 95% and the Marine's 90%.  I saw very little difference on dim objects like the Orion nebula or the background of the Pleides or Jupiter's moons.  Again, I can't see the justification for triple the price.<br /><br />Both have generious eye-relief, 20mm for the Marine and 22mm for these XP's.  They also have the same weight and dimensions.  They're heavy but still reasonable if you're wearing a thick coat to pad your chest and a harness to keep them from swinging all over if you're moving.  Also, at 7x they're reasonable for handholding.  For me, 7x50 is about the limit for handholding.  Heavier or higher power would be too shakey.  6x56 might be nicer if they were more common.<br /><br />Where the XP is clearly better is with small details like the click-loc strap attachments (for use with Steiner straps and harnesses only), the better eyepiece covers, lens covers, focuser grips, shading eye-cups, and various doo-dads that come in the case.  It comes with a flotation strap which the Marine doesn't, but I would still rather prefer a harness which neither comes with.<br /><br />I bought these Porro prism binos because I thought for the high price they should be outstanding.  While roof prism binos might require fifteen hundred dollars or more to achieve optical exellence (or so I've heard), it should be easier with porros.  With these, it's possible they lost collimation after leaving the factory but the optical quality is lacking nontheless.  To be honest, I have nothing to compare them to.  I've never seen better, but I was still totally underwhelmed by the performance which was only slightly better than I would expect from binoculars in the hundred dollar range.",1.0,i bought these at the same time as a steiner x marine model the commander xps use the same case but for triple the price have better eyepieces coatings and optical specifications and a few additional or better accessories than the marine modelbr br i compared them in terrestrial and celestial viewing but the easiest comparison is done with astronomical subjects since they really define performance clearly the images in the marine model merged effortless in the commander xp i have difficulty merging the images theyre obviously badly out of collimation i dont care to fix this myself on binos in this price rangebr br i evaluated the real and apparent fields of view as well as the sharpness near the edge of the fieldbr br in the marine model the real field of view is reasonably wide but apparent field is quite narrow its not bad but its not a spectacular vista either in the commander xp the real fov is only barely perceptibly wider steiners website lists the specifications the apparent field is about the same the almost indiscernable extra width of real fov does not contribute much to the value for triple the pricebr br on the marine model i put sirius and jupiter in the center of the field they look nice moving the binoculars so that the objects were farther from the center of the field i could see the image degraded about halfway to the edge of the field of view near the very edge the image was appalling much more than halfway out of the center of the field of view the star or planet turns from a bright point to just a smear near the very edge its a dim smudge i tried the same with the commander xp it was every bit as badbr br are the xps better on dim objects the optics are supposed to transmit light compared to the commander vs and the marines i saw very little difference on dim objects like the orion nebula or the background of the pleides or jupiters moons again i cant see the justification for triple the pricebr br both have generious eyerelief mm for the marine and mm for these xps they also have the same weight and dimensions theyre heavy but still reasonable if youre wearing a thick coat to pad your chest and a harness to keep them from swinging all over if youre moving also at x theyre reasonable for handholding for me x is about the limit for handholding heavier or higher power would be too shakey x might be nicer if they were more commonbr br where the xp is clearly better is with small details like the clickloc strap attachments for use with steiner straps and harnesses only the better eyepiece covers lens covers focuser grips shading eyecups and various doodads that come in the case it comes with a flotation strap which the marine doesnt but i would still rather prefer a harness which neither comes withbr br i bought these porro prism binos because i thought for the high price they should be outstanding while roof prism binos might require fifteen hundred dollars or more to achieve optical exellence or so ive heard it should be easier with porros with these its possible they lost collimation after leaving the factory but the optical quality is lacking nontheless to be honest i have nothing to compare them to ive never seen better but i was still totally underwhelmed by the performance which was only slightly better than i would expect from binoculars in the hundred dollar range,3349

"I'm sorry to say, after a year of trying, they just doesn't work. It will work, (work meaning you log in, click and see what's going on through your camera network) but it is not reliable, meaning it seems to have a 'weak' connection.

"I bought these for the first time in March 2019. They worked great (great bass) then they stopped working in August 2019. I didn't want to deal with the warranty process.

Again, they were working great and I loved them so much that I even bought my mom a pair (which she loves and is still using).<br /><br />Now, it's January 2020 (exactly five months out like the last time) and they've stopped working again. I'm disappointed because I really loved these headphones.

"Wasted about 4 hours solid of my night fighting with this thing. It would broadcast long enough for me to see it and connect to configure via the browser option, then as soon as I think I'm getting somewhere...BAM! It drops out. Like playing whack a mole. This went on for about 3 hours. I thought I was doing something wrong. Seemed like I FINALLY got it to connect...configured it, and not easily, and everything was up. And then it started connecting/disconnecting again....up for 10 seconds, down for 10 seconds, and repeat continuously just like this. It would do this to my laptop, desktop and my Linksys E1200 router the exact same way. Up and down up and down up and down. I tried absolutely every single solitary thing (more than once) to see if the problem was my devices, configs, etc., and I've concluded this thing is totally defective (probably a previous return).  What a headache and waste of time! I'm shipping it back for a replacement; if the next one does the same thing, which I think is highly likely, I'm shipping it back, getting a refund buying something that works. Waste of an entire night.<br /><br />**UPDATE** Next day. I ran the firmware update (had to connect via Ethernet because the connect/disconnect every 10 seconds was still happening). The connection stability issues were fixed...wowee wow! But now (big surprise) I get the notice any reviewer wrote about that I have to move it closer to my router because it can't see it. It's plenty close and just yet another glitch. Again I tried all kind of troubleshooting, and this new problem persists. I have a replacement arriving tomorrow. If I get any problems or errors whatsoever, it's immediately going back in the box, back to Amazon and I'm ordering a different extender from a different manufacturer, that...according to other reviewers, actually works.

Done w/this fiasco.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** FINALLY got this piece of garbage stable, fully functional and working properly.

"Owning a DSLR is all about using the right lens for the occasion, but sometimes a do-it-all lens makes travel or photo walks easier. While it is true the lens is soft wide open and at both ends of the zoom, stopping down fixes almost all of that. Also, barrel distortion is noticeable, but now that Light Room 4 has this lens in the library, fixing it in post is straight forward. In the end, it is about the pictures you can take, and I have been more than happy with all the shots I have taken so far.<br />Note, some reviewers have complained of the weight. I shoot this on D7000, and the balance is good. I have the 70-200 f2.8 nikkor lens, and it is much lighter than that.<br />Also, the zoom on this lens is nice and tight.

"I've been an avid fan of ebooks since the long gone days of the Rocket and the eBookman, and a fan of the Kindle since the very beginning.  This is miles and away the best there has ever been.  It is a luxury model, no doubt, but oh is it luxurious.<br /><br />I like:<br />The weight.  Even in the case it's very light, though if it gets much lighter I'll worry about it blowing away in a strong wind.<br />The size.  It's not going to get much smaller without shrinking the screen.<br />The interface.  I'm sorry, I like buttons.  Call me old.  I never bent back the spine of a book (horrors) so I can't compare the feel of this to that, but I can say it's nice for a long reading session.  The touch screen takes a bit of getting used to, but the tutorial will guide a new user. The tutorial is intrusive at first, but provides useful information and goes away quickly.  I will suggest customizing the screen.  I hated the default, but you get a lot of options to make it just the way you want.<br />The lighting is now all but invisible.  I was unhappy that you can't completely turn it off as you could with the Nook Glowlight, and turning it down casts an odd yellow light over the page, but it's so even now as to be so unintrusive I barely notice going from sunlight to tunnel on the bus home. With the Nook I'd be thrown out of the book to go turn on the light.  With the Kindle, I can keep reading without a pause.  It does not have adaptive lighting, but I'm not sure it needs it.<br />The download speed.  I don't know if it's supposed to be faster than the Kindle Keyboard (the last one I had with 3G) but it certainly seems that way.<br />The battery life.  Maybe with this thing going for months we'll finally hear an end to the &#34;but my dead tree doesn't run out of power&#34; nonsense.<br />Next in series. When you're almost done with a book, it tells you where the story continues.  Now the next feature I want, and if it does this I haven't seen it yet, is an alert when the next book in a series I'm following is published.  Yes, FictFact is great, but I'm greedy and want it right on the device.<br /><br />I don't like:<br />It's not waterproof.

"This Winegard antenna is worth the extra money for the pre-amplifier. Previously I had tried a different flat antenna, which was actually worst than the homemade wire di-pole I had previously strung along the edge of the ceiling. (The wire had to go because it didn't meet the wife acceptance factor ;).<br /><br />I'm a radio engineer by profession, so my gut feel from the beginning was that the pre-amp would be better, but I thought an unamplified passive antenna would be good enough. I was wrong. This Winegard amplified antenna picks up more signals than I've seen at my house before, and the tv-tuner scan completed much faster, suggesting it was able to decode the channels easier due to much better signal-to-noise ratio.<br /><br />Your television or digital tv tuner box has an amplifier in the back, but even if it included the best amplifier available (which it doesn't), you still can't get back all the signal that was lost in the coaxial cable run from the antenna to the tv. That's why it's important to amplify the signal as close to the source as possible, which is what this antenna does by sticking the amplifier in the plastic box on the base of the antenna itself. (The small plastic dongle toward the TV end of the cable is just a bias circuit to send power to the amplifier at the antenna end of the cable.)<br /><br />I'm comparing this Winegard antenna to the http://www.amazon.com/Mohu-Leaf-Paper-Thin-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B00HSMK580, which I purchased first and was not happy with. Even after moving it around, I still couldn't get even nearby VHF channels, which are most of what we're interested in. Too bad I already threw away the packaging and cannot return it.<br /><br />If you're farther from the station you're trying to watch, even this amplified indoor antenna may not work for you, and you'll have to get a larger attic or roof-mounted antenna. A site like tvfool dot com can tell you the signal levels and bearing of all the stations visible in your area, and tell you if they're strong enough for an indoor antenna.",5.0,this winegard antenna is worth the extra money for the preamplifier previously i had tried a different flat antenna which was actually worst than the homemade wire dipole i had previously strung along the edge of the ceiling the wire had to go because it didnt meet the wife acceptance factor br br im a radio engineer by profession so my gut feel from the beginning was that the preamp would be better but i thought an unamplified passive antenna would be good enough i was wrong this winegard amplified antenna picks up more signals than ive seen at my house before and the tvtuner scan completed much faster suggesting it was able to decode the channels easier due to much better signaltonoise ratiobr br your television or digital tv tuner box has an amplifier in the back but even if it included the best amplifier available which it doesnt you still cant get back all the signal that was lost in the coaxial cable run from the antenna to the tv thats why its important to amplify the signal as close to the source as possible which is what this antenna does by sticking the amplifier in the plastic box on the base of the antenna itself the small plastic dongle toward the tv end of the cable is just a bias circuit to send power to the amplifier at the antenna end of the cablebr br im comparing this winegard antenna to the which i purchased first and was not happy with even after moving it around i still couldnt get even nearby vhf channels which are most of what were interested in too bad i already threw away the packaging and cannot return itbr br if youre farther from the station youre trying to watch even this amplified indoor antenna may not work for you and youll have to get a larger attic or roofmounted antenna a site like tvfool dot com can tell you the signal levels and bearing of all the stations visible in your area and tell you if theyre strong enough for an indoor antenna,1904

"I have a good tangle of cables in my home office for a variety of devices that require a micro-USB cable. Most of these cables are very nondescript and I have no idea who made them, though there are a couple of them that have manufacturer names printed on the plugs on the end. Most are plain black and are mostly indistinguishable from one another. These cables from Magic-T are absolutely the most easily identifiable cables on the desk and it has made it very easy to assign cables to every device on the desk. But, there is more to these cables than just pretty colors.<br /><br />The most obvious advantage of this cable set is the colors. Each of these cables is a different color and none of them are black or gray - there’s blue, pink, orange and green. And, even more important than the color is the fact that they are insulated in nylon weave, not plastic coating, which in my experience holds up a bit better under stress and the result is a more reliable cable.<br /><br />The plugs on both ends are metal shielding with a plastic base, sufficient to give these strength for the connections. The cables have been inserted in the bases and attached within, not attached to the plug base, but those connections are very tight and seem to be solid so I am not concerned about them pulling loose.<br /><br />Each cable is about six and a half feet in length which is much more convenient for me than the regular 3' cables.<br /><br />These cables are capable of high-speed charging so if you have a device and a charger that are both capable of high-speed charging then these cables will work well for you. I used one for my tablet and a high-speed USB charger and the tablet did charge faster than when using a lower-grade cable.<br /><br />I want to mention the pricing. As I write this, the price on this set of four cables is about $9. That’s about $2.25 per cable, and the cables are of good quality. The price can change of course, but at the current price this is an absolute bargain.<br /><br />There’s something else I need to mention. The manufacturer offers a 12-month warranty on these cables, and to me that’s just amazing. For a cable that costs less than $2.50 per individual cable the manufacturer thinks enough of their product to back it with a 12-month warranty. I doubt I would ever need to use the warranty for one of these, but it’s reassuring to know the manufacturer believes in their products.<br /><br />It is hard to find fault with these cables. They are made well, they are easily identifiable and they are very inexpensive. This is a fine set at a great price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",5.0,i have a good tangle of cables in my home office for a variety of devices that require a microusb cable most of these cables are very nondescript and i have no idea who made them though there are a couple of them that have manufacturer names printed on the plugs on the end most are plain black and are mostly indistinguishable from one another these cables from magict are absolutely the most easily identifiable cables on the desk and it has made it very easy to assign cables to every device on the desk but there is more to these cables than just pretty colorsbr br the most obvious advantage of this cable set is the colors each of these cables is a different color and none of them are black or gray theres blue pink orange and green and even more important than the color is the fact that they are insulated in nylon weave not plastic coating which in my experience holds up a bit better under stress and the result is a more reliable cablebr br the plugs on both ends are metal shielding with a plastic base sufficient to give these strength for the connections the cables have been inserted in the bases and attached within not attached to the plug base but those connections are very tight and seem to be solid so i am not concerned about them pulling loosebr br each cable is about six and a half feet in length which is much more convenient for me than the regular cablesbr br these cables are capable of highspeed charging so if you have a device and a charger that are both capable of highspeed charging then these cables will work well for you i used one for my tablet and a highspeed usb charger and the tablet did charge faster than when using a lowergrade cablebr br i want to mention the pricing as i write this the price on this set of four cables is about thats about per cable and the cables are of good quality the price can change of course but at the current price this is an absolute bargainbr br theres something else i need to mention the manufacturer offers a month warranty on these cables and to me thats just amazing for a cable that costs less than per individual cable the manufacturer thinks enough of their product to back it with a month warranty i doubt i would ever need to use the warranty for one of these but its reassuring to know the manufacturer believes in their productsbr br it is hard to find fault with these cables they are made well they are easily identifiable and they are very inexpensive this is a fine set at a great pricebr br disclaimer i was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair honest and thorough review even though i received this product at no cost i have rated and reviewed this product without bias based solely on my experience with it,2722

"I purchased this Panasonic Soundbar in June of 2013.  At the time, my requirements were:<br /> - Good sound (can't afford GREAT sound)<br /> - Wireless Subwoofer<br /> - HDMI input and good HDMI-CEC support<br /> - Bluetooth support<br /><br />In my search, I tested the [[ASIN:B00811NMMI Toshiba SBX4250]] and the [[ASIN:B00BLX9510 Samsung HW-F450]] from my local Costco.  My final choice was the Panasonic.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> - Acceptable sound -- The front speakers are not a big improvement over the built-ins.  With the subwoofer turned off, it is easy to mistake the Panasonic sound bar with the speakers from the Television.<br /> - Good subwoofer -- The sub sounds good even at high volumes and fills out the overall sound from the sound bar.<br /> - The Samsung has clearer mid and high ranges so the Panasonic seems slightly muffled in comparison.<br /> - Overall sound better than the Toshiba.<br /> - Wireless range for the subwoofer is short -- especially if placed behind the sofa (interference from people sitting in front of it).  Range is about 15 feet with clear line of sight.<br /><br />Decoders and Passthrough:<br /> - AC3 and DTS Decoder (Toshiba lacks DTS)<br />- ARC (Audio Return Channel) -- If you use the Netflix app built in to your TV, audio is generated by your TV.  Normally, an ""optical out"" cable from the TV back to the sound bar is necessary.  ARC removes that need.<br /><br />HDMI-CEC (also Aquos Link, Anynet+, Bravia LinkSync, Regza Link, etc):<br />This is where the Panasonic beats the Samsung.  HDMI-CEC allows Televisions to control a connected device -- no matter the brand;  The TV remote should be able to turn on a bluray player and send navigation (up/down/etc) and standard playback buttons without the need for a second remote control.<br /><br />In the case of a sound bar, through HDMI-CEC:<br /> 1. The sound bar should turn on when the TV turns on -- Panasonic does this, Samsung does not.<br /> 2. The TV should play all sound through the sound bar and volume buttons on the TV remote should control volume on the sound bar -- Panasonic does this.<br /> 3. Turning on a bluray player, the sound bar should turn on and switch to the correct input automatically.  The TV should also turn on and switch to the correct input -- Panasonic does this.  It's then up to your TV do its part.<br /><br />In conclusion, I chose the Panasonic because it gave me the ability to eliminate a remote control through HDMI-CEC (which Samsung didn't) and it had both AC3 and DTS decoders (which Toshiba didn't).  With the added ability to play music from my phone through bluetooth, I'm still happy with my purchase one year later.<br /><br />Tip:  Unlike the Samsung and Toshiba, the Panasonic has a small ""receiver"" unit that adds another machine to your entertainment center.  For me, I use some velcro strips and attach the ""receiver"" to the back of my TV.  It is only 1 ¾"" thick which was thinner than my wall mount.",5.0,i purchased this panasonic soundbar in june of at the time my requirements werebr good sound cant afford great soundbr wireless subwooferbr hdmi input and good hdmicec supportbr bluetooth supportbr br in my search i tested the asinbnmmi toshiba sbx and the asinbblx samsung hwf from my local costco my final choice was the panasonicbr br soundbr acceptable sound the front speakers are not a big improvement over the builtins with the subwoofer turned off it is easy to mistake the panasonic sound bar with the speakers from the televisionbr good subwoofer the sub sounds good even at high volumes and fills out the overall sound from the sound barbr the samsung has clearer mid and high ranges so the panasonic seems slightly muffled in comparisonbr overall sound better than the toshibabr wireless range for the subwoofer is short especially if placed behind the sofa interference from people sitting in front of it range is about feet with clear line of sightbr br decoders and passthroughbr ac and dts decoder toshiba lacks dtsbr arc audio return channel if you use the netflix app built in to your tv audio is generated by your tv normally an optical out cable from the tv back to the sound bar is necessary arc removes that needbr br hdmicec also aquos link anynet bravia linksync regza link etcbr this is where the panasonic beats the samsung hdmicec allows televisions to control a connected device no matter the brand the tv remote should be able to turn on a bluray player and send navigation updownetc and standard playback buttons without the need for a second remote controlbr br in the case of a sound bar through hdmicecbr the sound bar should turn on when the tv turns on panasonic does this samsung does notbr the tv should play all sound through the sound bar and volume buttons on the tv remote should control volume on the sound bar panasonic does thisbr turning on a bluray player the sound bar should turn on and switch to the correct input automatically the tv should also turn on and switch to the correct input panasonic does this its then up to your tv do its partbr br in conclusion i chose the panasonic because it gave me the ability to eliminate a remote control through hdmicec which samsung didnt and it had both ac and dts decoders which toshiba didnt with the added ability to play music from my phone through bluetooth im still happy with my purchase one year laterbr br tip unlike the samsung and toshiba the panasonic has a small receiver unit that adds another machine to your entertainment center for me i use some velcro strips and attach the receiver to the back of my tv it is only thick which was thinner than my wall mount,2666

"Wow, I LOVE this!  I didn't even know iPhone keyboards existed until I happened to see one (another brand) at Best Buy.  I can't say how many times I've wanted to respond to an email or text on my phone, but waited until I got to a computer so I could type fast instead of picking it out key by key (I'm old lol).  This seemed the perfect solution.  I had a hard time deciding which one to get, as there are very similar ones, but for some reason felt most confident ordering this one.  The magnetic case is nice looking and sturdy, and when folded around the keyboard, looks kind of  like a diary.  But open it up and there is the keyboard, folded into thirds.  As soon as you unfold it to use, it instantly comes on!  Paired immediately with my smartphone.  As long as you have a flat surface you are set.

Took me a minute or two until I figured out the bag-like item was the soft flash diffuser. Felt a little silly about that, but then again, it wasn't labeled.<br />About 99% of the reason I bought this was the flash unit itself. I do sports photos as a volunteer for our church, and needed something with more horsepower than the built-in flash from the Canon T2i I use for the photos. This flash is way cheaper than the Canon flashes, and seems to be just as strong. Canon wants $300+ for equivalent models.<br />Shipping was fast, customer service is great.

This laptop was nearly $880 through dell with a 3 year tech and accidental.  However with amazon $599 Prime + $100 Square trade 3 year hardware with accidental made it a steal. The laptop comes with 1 year dell support which I used the first day.  The lap top doesn't come with a WIN 7 DVD which I required to upgrade to a SSD. Dell overnighted it to me for free. With the SSD it boots in 16 seconds.  The Hard drive is Extremely easy to access.  Two screws on the back of the laptop then d/c the Hard drive and plop in your SSD.  The mouse buttons are annoyingly loud.  The battery lasts a long time.  It dropped 10% over an hour while I was viewing power-point slides for class.  Over all I couldn't be happier.

Great, fast shipping! Packaged nicely, not over or under packed. I put the screen protector on first. Fits perfectly, holes in the protector for both the camera and the home button.<br />  Next, take the three pieces of the case apart, gently! The hard pieces must be pried apart with care, I was afraid I could crack them so I did it slowly. If you don't have patience, ask a friend to do this. Place your iPad between the two hard plastic pieces than snap these two pieces back together. (No instructions) Be sure all the way around is closed without gaps or it isn't completely closed and could come apart if it was dropped. Once all edges are closed, slip the soft silicone back cover on. This silicone will fit very nicely into cut outs all around the edges. There is a flap where the plug goes in the bottom of the iPad as well as the headphone jack.<br />  Yes, this all adds weight to your iPad but I prefer the weight to the security of knowing if I drop this, most likely nothing will get busted! I also like the secure hold I have holding the silicone.<br />  The only thing missing is a kickstand but of course I knew that before my purchase.

Still learning about the options.<br /><br />I then asked the software to convert my written test to TEXT.  My handwriting is not bad, but it isn't great either.  First shot out of the barn and it was right on!  The result is above in the image.<br /><br />Next, I asked it to save my written test as a STICKY NOTE and I dragged the note on to me desktop.  Bling!  Amazing again.  But when I toggled over to Outlook, the note disappeared ... have to learn more about this.<br /><br />Then, I asked it to save as a PAPER HOLDER (?) and dragged it to my Outlook screen.  Cha-ching!  There it went and it stayed on top in Outlook this time.  I toggled over to my Explorer window and Bling!  It was still right on top.  My heart is beating with excitement for this new toy!!!<br /><br />> You must have the software open to see your notes on screen.  Ditto for keeping the STICKY NOTES or PAPER HOLDERS on top of a program.  Not so for on-the-road.  It will store your notes in the receiver's memory.  I have to learn more ... remember, it's only an hour old!<br /><br />RECEIVER has a MULTI-FUNCTION BUTTON to toggle between using the pen as a MOUSE and NOTE TAKER.  Default is a mouse.  To use the NOTE TAKER feature just push the button on the RECEIVER.  You will see an icon on the RECEIVER SCREEN that tells you what mode you are in.  First test as a MOUSE told me I'm too fast on the mouse to make this a good mouse toy. IOGear says, if using as a mouse, you are best SWITCHING THE PEN CARTRIDGE TO A STYLUS CARTRIDGE.  COMMENT:  Switching the pen cartridge will likely be a pain and not worthwhile unless you plan more mouse activity than note taking.<br />> update:  It comes with a stylus.  Fell out of the package when I opened it.  Found later; it's black, small and thin. Take care when you open the pen cartridge bag.<br /><br />PEN has a BUTTON on it; located by your forefinger.  Button functions as a SINGLE MOUSE CLICK; maybe more ... have to read more instructions.<br />ABOUT THIS ITEM:<br />- PEN SIZE is as a typical pen (not fat or clumsy).<br />- RECEIVER is small and light; I hope I don't lose it on the road.<br />- NOTE-TAKING does not require USB attach to your computer; it has a memory for your download later.<br />- PACKAGE comes with everything you need; INCLUDES USB, the PEN, PEN BATTERIES, PEN CARTRIDGE, STYLUS CARTRIDGE, OPERATION SOFTWARE and TEXT CONVERSION SOFTWARE.<br /><br />Not sure what the reviewer means who talks about needing a cardboard support for the RECEIVER.  I attached the RECEIVER to a few pages in my 1/2"" thick spiral bound notebook.  Attached comfortably to the top 3 pages with no problems.<br /><br />If you take notes and don't want to spend time looking for them 2 days later, or want to keep a permanent record, this is a must have!<br />I'll be back if anything changes.  For now, its a full 5 stars.<br /><br />I was not able to find any of these products at Retail to touch and feel.

"If you're looking for an affordable OTA antenna, then you've probably seen A LOT of them over the course of your research. I went back & forth on a few, but finally pulled the trigger & went with this unit. And I'm glad I did! After using for almost one month, it has exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />The unit came well packed from the vendor with all of the parts needed for the installation. You will need a few tools for the mounting portion of your install, but these will be determined by where you mount (indoors or outdoors). The manual will explain further. The documentation is OK (not great), but you will be able to complete the project from what is provided.<br /><br />This kit ships with a mounting pole, 40' RG6 coax, a rotor control (to remotely turn the antenna), a pre-amp, the antenna & mounting hardware. Some light assembly is required, but it's very straightforward.<br /><br />**There is a model of this antenna that is cheaper, but DOES NOT SHIP with a mounting pole. So make sure you select the correct version for your application.**<br /><br />Also, some OTA antennas DO NOT included coax, a mounting pole or a pre-amp. These will be additional expenses on top of the purchase of your antenna. So make sure you read the details on any antenna that you consider purchasing. This model includes all of these items.<br /><br />Of course, for the price, you're not receiving a top of the line pre-amp, or for that matter high quality RG6, but for most applications it should suffice just fine. Especially if you install indoors (mine was an attic install) where it will be protected from the elements.<br /><br />And for anyone wondering, the pre-amp IS powered by the rotor control box (not by the coax feed). So if you opt not to use the rotor (to turn the antenna on demand) then you will not be able to use the pre-amp.<br /><br />So if you need the pre-amp, you will have to connect up the rotor control even if it won't be used. However, if neither are needed, then they can be bypassed entirely.<br /><br />Also, you can run this antenna directly into a signal booster (drop amplifier) like a PCT (PCT-VC-9U). These can be found on Amazon for around $50.00 - $100.00 depending on size & features you need. So if you already have coax jacks in your house that are in place from previous cable or satellite TV, then you can repurpose those jacks for your new antenna. This way you can distribute your antenna signal to all (or most) of the TV's in your house!<br /><br />Please note that your location, proximity to your broadcast towers, potential points of interference (trees, building, mountains, etc..) & height of your mount are a HUGE DEAL when using ANY OTA antenna.<br /><br />I'm located in FL, so it's pretty flat. However, most of the broadcast towers are 30-45 miles away.  As well, the antenna was mounted indoors & at the most 15' to 16' in the air. So it is fairly low. However, even with an indoor installation (and not using the pre-amp) , this antenna easily picked up 57 OTA channels!<br /><br />So while some people blame the antenna when they can only pick up a few stations, there are many other moving parts involved to get this all to work.<br /><br />If this is your first time installing an OTA antenna, then PLEASE use a free site like ""tvfool"" or ""antennaweb"" (Google these) to determine what direction your broadcast towers are in relation to where you will be mounting your antenna. These services will also tell you what channels are going to be achievable with the antenna of your choosing. All you do is plug in your address & the site will serve up all of the info that you need. Do this BEFORE you buy any antenna to make sure it's even worth your time.<br /><br />One last thing, be sure to re-scan your channels on your TV every now & again. Channels get repacked (put under different channel assignments) & new channels get added. So if a channel that was coming in suddenly disappears, it may not be your antenna, but the broadcast signal itself.<br /><br />Overall, this antenna was easy to install. Since I mounted indoors, I used two 2"" wood screws with washers right into a truss to mount the mast. The antenna goes on with 2 bolts (ratchet & socket do well here) & you're done. I can't personally speak to an outdoor installation, but would have to assume that it would be a bit more involved.<br /><br />I shortened the included RG6 cable (only dual shield not quad shield) to around 15' as my equipment panel was directly below the antenna in the laundry room. If you decide to do this, then you will need to crimp on a new compression connector on one end of the cable. However, you can purchase an entire kit on Amazon (with F connectors, coax stripper & the crimp tool) for under $20.00 (Bestar #3189 (Blue-F) ). It's VERY easy. You can do it!<br /><br />As well, having a shorter run can only help your signal performance. So if you have excess cable after your install, consider shortening it to the exact length that you need.<br /><br />The hardest part of the install is dialing in the perfect sweet spot for your broadcast towers. The best thing you can do is use the websites noted above to get the direction of the towers BEFORE you do your install. Then bring a compass (yes, a real compass) or use a compass on your smartphone (this is what I did & it worked perfectly) to help point your antenna in the correct direction. If you have a helper, then have them scan the channels once you lock on to your desired direction. It may take a few attempts, but it's worth it (especially if you don't use the rotor function). Cell phones or walkie talkies do nicely here :-)<br /><br />And if you ever need it, their support was great. It's only email based, but they responded within 24 hrs. Very willing to help & get any questions answered.<br /><br />If things change, I will update this review. However, after almost a month of use, I've been very happy with this kit. It feels great not paying the cable company to provide stations that are otherwise floating around us for free -in uncompressed HD!",5.0,if youre looking for an affordable ota antenna then youve

"I have used and tested more Ethernet cables than I can remember and there is no question, all Ethernet cables are not created equally.<br /><br />Typically any device requiring an Ethernet cable will come with one in the packaging - it will work (usually).  A good comparison is those cables are much like an old car - it should get you there, whereas this cable is like a high end sports car - it will get you there lightning fast, without fail.<br /><br />This Cat8 is extra thick due to the shielding within and the additional insulation.  The connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug.  The connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivity.<br /><br />This Cat8 Ethernet Cable is 30’ long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your TV or gaming system into your router.  So many of us stream programs and movies via our TV and there is no comparison in speed between a WiFi connection and a wired connection.  For gamers, it is absolutely the way to go - do away with all lag caused by your WiFi by connecting directly to your router.<br /><br />You will not find a better 30’ Ethernet Cable - this is really a top of the line cable that you’ll love.  This is a purchase that you’ll never regret.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

"I've been having a really hard time finding earbuds for my really small ears. I hate my ears and it has been a struggle for the last 10 years. My first legitimate pair were the Bose Soundsport. They were great at first but absolutely hated the fact they stuck out so far. I ended up selling them.<br /><br />Then I saw these. They are under $200 and I was like screw it, I'm going to get them. They are a great fit. Unfortunately I cannot wear them for long periods of time due to my small, shitty ears that God has blessed me with. I like using them while riding the stationary bike at home, cooking, walking my dogs, and doing yoga. They are also great because they don't stick so far out of my ear like the Bose Soundsport. The battery life of the charging case is great too. I didn't have to charge the buds for a month (fyi I only use these while working out and keep at a low volume). The noise cancelling is awesome.

"I wasn't sure what to expect, never having used pens for coloring before. I wanted to try some without paying a premium price, so this seemed like a good starter set.<br /><br />These guys are just flat fun to play with! I can see that some colors would work best on colored paper - white, for instance. Almost all pens wrote smoothly and dried almost instantly. One or two felt a bit scratchy but maybe they just need to be broken in some. I noticed no odor while using them. There was no bleed-through in any of the Dover Publications books - a lighter touch and moving more quickly over the paper was needed to prevent bleed-through in an Angie Grace book but since there are no pictures on the back of the pages that really isnt an issue.<br /><br />I have no idea how long these will last, but feel like I got a great deal for the price",5.0,i wasnt sure what to expect never having used pens for coloring before i wanted to try some without paying a premium price so this seemed like a good starter setbr br these guys are just flat fun to play with i can see that some colors would work best on colored paper white for instance almost all pens wrote smoothly and dried almost instantly one or two felt a bit scratchy but maybe they just need to be broken in some i noticed no odor while using them there was no bleedthrough in any of the dover publications books a lighter touch and moving more quickly over the paper was needed to prevent bleedthrough in an angie grace book but since there are no pictures on the back of the pages that really isnt an issuebr br i have no idea how long these will last but feel like i got a great deal for the price,810

"[[VIDEOID:e282cc4a35b963fb4926a6018eb35486]] I was very impressed by the quality of this camera. it worked literally flowless as a real plug and play should work and the quality is great. The resolution of the video is great, and the light is a perfect addition for a perfect look at the so many virtual meetings we need to attend these days.<br /><br />The ring light has three settings and it doesn't disturb the vision, in other words, it is not very bright and it is bearable. Also, something very important is that you can turn the camera and adjust the angle, something you can't do with classic cameras. Overall, I am very impressed, the video quality is not that different from another camera I own which costed 3 times more.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera with no hesitation. I am sure you won't regret the purchase.",5.0,videoideccabfbaeb i was very impressed by the quality of this camera it worked literally flowless as a real plug and play should work and the quality is great the resolution of the video is great and the light is a perfect addition for a perfect look at the so many virtual meetings we need to attend these daysbr br the ring light has three settings and it doesnt disturb the vision in other words it is not very bright and it is bearable also something very important is that you can turn the camera and adjust the angle something you cant do with classic cameras overall i am very impressed the video quality is not that different from another camera i own which costed times morebr br i would recommend this camera with no hesitation i am sure you wont regret the purchase,776
"Where have I been that I did not know about this brand and its head-rockin quality? First, let's start off with the innocuous vintage design. It looks like something that might be on diner countertop from the 50's but when you turn that baby on and UP? Space age indeed. True audiophiles will love the ability to tweak the settings exactly to their liking and pairing and app setup takes all of minutes. This speaker is not only a wonderful conversation piece, it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Speaking of conversations, let's move on to Alexa. This is native to this new edition and all you have to do is sign in and and off you go! Given the recently curious publicity about Alexa cackling into the night or calling folks and snitching (LOL), I was rather wary about this feature but quickly grew on me when I saw not only how easy it is to use, but how QUICKLY you can turn it off. There are lights that indicate whether or not this feature is enabled, thank goodness!<br /><br />This is such a remarkable speaker. It fits just about anywhere yet delivers a sound that will rattle the walls. Maaaaayunnnn, I am in LOVE. *fifty billion heart eye emojis* It looks so, SO cool - because it is - and yet, the price is hot!

"This TV arrived yesterday, fast shipping UPS, box in great shape, well packed and no damage.  Ordered this for a bedroom and already have a TV in our living room with a Fire TV box.  No problem setting up or connecting to Wifi and our router is on a different floor.  Be sure to have your passwords handy, the layout mirrored our other TV, but you will need to download apps like Netflix and Hulu.  TV works great, color and sound are fantastic.  What took me to most time was to link the TV to my echo device so I included directions below.  I discovered you cannot turn the TV on hands-free using the echo unless you refer to the TV as ""Fire TV"", not just ""TV"".  Example ""Alexa, turn on Fire TV"".  The only small negative I have is the red light at the bottom of the TV stays on when the TV is turned off.  Not a big deal except at night in a bedroom if you have a sensitivity to lights when you're sleeping.  I'm just going to put electrical tape over it.<br /><br />We wall mounted ours using the Mounting Dream 26-55 Inch TVs, Full Motion TV Wall Mount MD2413-MX.

Then she knew to automatically stop playing it after an hour. She was  Perfect at getting me to unwind and get to sleep. I fell in love with Alexa. She was the best wife anyone could ask for. Easily deserving a full 5 star review.... Until this morning when Alexa died peacefully in her sleep sometime last night. I tried everything to revive her, tapping, slapping, crying, even different outlets.  But Alexa was gone. She is dead. But ONLY TWO WEEKS OLD!!!! Not acceptable, Amazon... NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!<br /><br />UPDATE... ALEXA IS ALIVE!!! Turns out she was downstream from a GFI switch that tripped. So was the 2nd outlet I plugged her into.  Don't laugh... sorry, Amazon.

"Update - the kindly people at Snugg sent me a new case, frankly, I wasn't real enthused about it, I figured it would probably still have the design flaws that made it a worthless $20 investment, but I was wrong, wrong, wrong.  That will show me to stop being such a pessimist.  I couldn't be happier with this now, it is everything I was hoping for, it clips on to the strap of my apron when I'm getting my cooking on, it hooks onto my backpack when I'm out riding.  All in all, it is wonderful.<br /><br />The headphone/earbud thingies I use, pretty standard ones called Coby also the ones that came with my ipod are able to make contact with the bottom portal which is now clear of the protective rubber.  The carabiner clip seems slightly more substantial, I'd have to weigh it or take it apart somehow to verify this part.<br /><br />So here's my old review, use this for info, in case you end up with a flawed Snugg, I guess you should just return it then, or maybe the bugs have been worked out now and all new Snuggs are good.  Anyways, here's the old review with a listing of the pertinent problems.<br /><br /> !OLD REVIEW!<br /><br />The problems Other people have mentioned, mainly the difficulty inserting the nano into the clip case, wasn't really a problem for me.  After watching my husband struggle with it for a few minutes I pulled it away from him and decided to do it myself.  I was aided in this task by two things, 1) I have more fine motor skills than he does and a lot more experience with tiny detail work (painting, beading, etc) and 2) I have fingernails, real ones not acrylic (I think acrylic nails would be too thick).<br /><br />I used the thin edge of my fingernail to seat the bottom of the nano in the case after sliding it top first under the rubber part at the top of the clip case.<br /><br />Once it was in my iPod did appear to be very secure.  The carabina clip is a bit of an exaggeration, it isn't nearly as sturdy as a carabiner, the like of which is used by climbers, this is more of a jewelry version and feels very lightweight, I'm not pleased with that.<br /><br />I paid $8 more for the clip aspect of this case and the clip is there but isn't as functional and sturdy as I'd hoped.<br /><br />The second fail for this case is that the rubber casing covers part of the headphone port.<br /><br />I bought this case along with my new iPod, so once I'd unpacked both, I loaded a new audiobook onto my new iPod and slipped the case on and decided to take a listen.  Nothing.<br /><br />I couldn't hear anything at all.  It was so disappointing.  For a moment I thought that my new iPod was defective.  Nope.<br /><br />It turns out that there wasn't enough room for the headphone jack to make a complete connection unless you peeled back the case wall and held it in place while listening.<br /><br />So annoying.<br /><br />Anyways, I have a x-acto knife and have been debating whether or not to modify the bottom of the case myself (the clip isn't great and it kinda ticks me off that I have to act as seamstress for this failure of a product if I want to use it).  But sending stuff back is tedious and time consuming (okay, it takes about five minutes to return stuff on Amazon, but still, I don't want to do it!).",5.0,update the kindly people at snugg sent me a new case frankly i wasnt real enthused about it i figured it would probably still have the design flaws that made it a worthless investment but i was wrong wrong wrong that will show me to stop being such a pessimist i couldnt be happier with this now it is everything i was hoping for it clips on to the strap of my apron when im getting my cooking on it hooks onto my backpack when im out riding all in all it is wonderfulbr br the headphoneearbud thingies i use pretty standard ones called coby also the ones that came with my ipod are able to make contact with the bottom portal which is now clear of the protective rubber the carabiner clip seems slightly more substantial id have to weigh it or take it apart somehow to verify this partbr br so heres my old review use this for info in case you end up with a flawed snugg i guess you should just return it then or maybe the bugs have been worked out now and all new snuggs are good anyways heres the old review with a listing of the pertinent problemsbr br old reviewbr br the problems other people have mentioned mainly the difficulty inserting the nano into the clip case wasnt really a problem for me after watching my husband struggle with it for a few minutes i pulled it away from him and decided to do it myself i was aided in this task by two things i have more fine motor skills than he does and a lot more experience with tiny detail work painting beading etc and i have fingernails real ones not acrylic i think acrylic nails would be too thickbr br i used the thin edge of my fingernail to seat the bottom of the nano in the case after sliding it top first under the rubber part at the top of the clip casebr br once it was in my ipod did appear to be very secure the carabina clip is a bit of an exaggeration it isnt nearly as sturdy as a carabiner the like of which is used by climbers this is more of a jewelry version and feels very lightweight im not pleased with thatbr br i paid more for the clip aspect of this case and the clip is there but isnt as functional and sturdy as id hopedbr br the second fail for this case is that the rubber casing covers part of the headphone portbr br i bought this case along with my new ipod so once id unpacked both i loaded a new audiobook onto my new ipod and slipped the case on and decided to take a listen nothingbr br i couldnt hear anything at all it was so disappointing for a moment i thought that my new ipod was defective nopebr br it turns out that there wasnt enough room for the headphone jack to make a complete connection unless you peeled back the case wall and held it in place while listeningbr br so annoyingbr br anyways i have a xacto knife and have been debating whether or not to modify the bottom of the case myself the clip isnt great and it kinda ticks me off that i have to act as seamstress for this failure of a product if i want to use it but sending stuff back is tedious and time consuming okay it takes about five minutes to return stuff on amazon but still i dont want to do it,3067

"I've tried a couple of the USB fans and have found them to be loud, ineffective at moving air, or unwilling to hold a set position (and sometimes all three at the same time). This fan, however, actually works. And it works very well!<br /><br />The build quality is impressive given the price. The gooseneck stalk is sturdy, and holds the fan in the position set without drooping or creeping down over time. The noise output is minor - you can hear it, but the sound is very muted and not at all objectionable.<br /><br />What really impressed me is the amount of air this moves. It actually moves enough air to make a difference, which is something that is not often seen in a USB personal fan. Great for the office, but also an effective cooling fan when exercising on something such as a treadmill.<br /><br />I'm using this by powering it with a powerbank. Very little battery drain in use - I left it running overnight attached to a small powerbank (8400mAh) and the power indicator on the powerbank showed it was still at the 75% level.<br /><br />Best USB fan I've used bar none - highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",5.0,ive tried a couple of the usb fans and have found them to be loud ineffective at moving air or unwilling to hold a set position and sometimes all three at the same time this fan however actually works and it works very wellbr br the build quality is impressive given the price the gooseneck stalk is sturdy and holds the fan in the position set without drooping or creeping down over time the noise output is minor you can hear it but the sound is very muted and not at all objectionablebr br what really impressed me is the amount of air this moves it actually moves enough air to make a difference which is something that is not often seen in a usb personal fan great for the office but also an effective cooling fan when exercising on something such as a treadmillbr br im using this by powering it with a powerbank very little battery drain in use i left it running overnight attached to a small powerbank mah and the power indicator on the powerbank showed it was still at the levelbr br best usb fan ive used bar none highly recommendbr sample provided for review,1069

"Power supplies are an easy to overlook part of a build. Enough watts is enough watts right? It's a tempting part of the build to try to skimp on and save a few bucks. But it's a worthwhile investment to get a trusted brand. A PSU can survive multiple builds. You'll be upgrading other parts long before you have to replace a quality PSU. This investment in the future saves money in the long run. Not to mention the peace of mind that it won't catch fire or something!<br /><br />Trusted brands and quality PSU's don't all have to be Gold and Platinum though. You don't have to go all out. Doesn't hurt if you can afford it. But a quality Bronze is miles ahead of a generic Gold that has over promised. I was slapping this thing in a HTPC build and just wanted reliability. It's more than enough. EVGA uses and contracts out quality manufacturers on their PSU lines. Of which they arguably have too many. But you're almost assuredly in good hands with EVGA PSUs. Their customer service is amazing and second to none, which is becoming increasingly hard to come by in the tech space.<br /><br />As of the writing of this EVGA is the whole package.

"While these headphones are certainly not small, they do fold up conveniently and they come with a nice carry bag.  However, while since is a factor, the overriding question is:  how do they sound?  How do they feel after wearing them for hours?<br /><br />The answer to both of these question is FANTASTIC!  The sound is extremely clean and effortless.  I watched the movie &#34;Arrival&#34; with them on, which includes a lot of very low frequency content.  Amazing!  Music is pure and the sonic field is very well represented.<br /><br />After hours on your head, they still feel comfortable.  This is due to the fact that they barely touch your ears.  The soft cups surround your ears rather than press on them.<br /><br />So the term &#34;Monitor&#34; in the title of this product is well deserved.  Yamaha is a great brand name (my receiver/amp is Yamaha), and I have to say, the overall quality of their products in general is excellent.  These headphones are no exception.<br /><br />They also come with two cords - one coiled, one not.  The cord is removable, and also locks into place so it will not dislodge accidentally.  It also includes the usual ¼&#34; phone plug attachment to the mini plugs.<br /><br />if you are looking for style, or inconspicuous, forget it with these earphones.

"This powerful, silent, unmanaged Ethernet switch has 24 fast PoE ports (100 Mbps) that not only provide high speed internet (2 Gigabit Uplink) but automatically detects if the plugged in device needs power and, if so, how much!<br /><br />I did thorough testing on this unit over the last several months and I am thoroughly impressed by the performance.<br /><br />By utilizing the built in chip this switch will provide up to 30 watts to every Ethernet device connected (up to a total of 360 watts) but will not provide any power to devices that do not require power.  I found that this switch works absolutely flawlessly.<br /><br />Having the capability to provide ample internet speed and power at the same time makes this switch perfect for both business environments and as a hub for security systems.<br /><br />I used this switch within my security system setup and mounted it within my security closet.  I love that it is easily wall mountable but it can also be mounted within a rack with no problem.<br /><br />I’ve tested my unit extensively using different security cameras and the results are nothing short of incredible.  While most security cameras can be run via WiFi, nearly all of them still require a power adapter be plugged in.  By utilizing this hub, security breaches are all but eliminated - by utilizing Ethernet instead of Wifi transmission your local storage unit makes it so there is no easy out of network access.  In addition, transfer speed, resolution and picture quality is greatly increased - making the entire system more useful.  In my experience, I found power is much easier to manage utilizing this method as opposed to having to run separate power supplies to each camera.<br /><br />I have found this switch is rock solid and perfect for use as an unmanaged PoE switch for security cameras.<br /><br />This is an all around outstanding product that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.

"Just got this case, and I'm mostly pleased. It does add a bit of weight to the overall situation, so that has to be a trade off you are willing to make.<br /><br />The leather is nice. I got the Pro as a work machine, and this makes it feel more official. It has the look and feel of a nice paper notebook folio, which is what I was going for. It looks nice open and closed. It feels overall very sturdy, which I am sure contributes to the overall heft. Again, that's a trade off. Can't wait to take handwritten notes on this with the Pencil.<br /><br />As can see in the attached photo, in the first stop, it has just enough room to hold a Sharkk Bluetooth keyboard. This is effectively a laptop at that point. :) Together, they are WAY cheaper than the Apple Keyboard. Not as convenient, but I don't know how much I'll be typing on this. Will see.<br /><br />The lowest stop feels most comfortable for viewing in your lap.<br /><br />It feels a bit odd if you're thinking of it as a notebook (I mean the paper kind) folio, where you'd just flip and wrap the cover around. This is because of the dual function flap to hold it for viewing. I imagine it will take some getting used to and maybe breaking it in.<br /><br />The pen/stylus holder is another feature that made me buy this one. Given that the Apple Pencil has no way to attach, by default. It is elastic and thin enough that I expect it will hold the Pencil just fine. (I am still waiting on my Pencil like everyone else.)

"Wireless headphones are great, but I have a love/hate relationship with using Bluetooth on a PC. When using the mic with headset profile for calls, the audio gets routed totally differently than regular stereo sound (A2DP), which gets confusing if multitasking and playing sound while also using the mic. And then there's the delay/lag etc that usually comes along with Bluetooth from a Windows desktop. But that's why I love the USB dongle here!<br />Plug the little USB bit in, and it detects the headphones like an alternate sound card, full blown crystal clear stereo audio, even if using the mic! And the mic can be extended or retracted, something I love since I lost the removable mic on my old headphones.<br />But, if I want to use it with my phone or tablet, I can revert to standard Bluetooth and connect that way on my Android devices. The price is a little bit steep, but the quality is there, this is a well designed and well made product that works as intended so far.

It's fast, lag-free even when gaming and streaming videos simultaneously (on different devices), and reliable. It was surprisingly easy to set-up too. I dumped the Netgear Armor on setup, which I'm told can cause issues and costs extra after the 30-day ""trial,"" but that was easy to do through their app. The app itself is reasonably user friendly and made setup a breeze.

"Since I already had an Amazon account setup was super easy. I would say within 5 minutes for each camera it was setup and working. I did download the Amazon Cloud Cam app first before I plugged in the camera for setup. It has to boot up and get into setup mode which took about 3 minutes.<br />Caught the two cameras I ordered on sale for $59 each which was a really nice price point. I would say they are worth the full price after using for a week.<br />I had read reviews and many of the downside issues like reconnecting to wifi after and internet outage or power outage seem to have been totally resolved with updates for software and or firmware. You can unplug and move to another room and when it boots up it reconnects to wifi. Same with an internet outage when re-established it will connect back to the network. At least both mentioned above have been my experience.<br />Picture quality I would assume is mainly a matter of your internet connection to the cloud. I live rural and only have a 6mb DSL service and both cameras work and record to the cloud. Picture quality is okay but I am sure it would be much better if I had a higher bandwidth like most people that live in a city.<br />You can setup schedules for when the camera should be on or off, you can setup HomeAway so if you leave the house the camera will automatically come when your phone GPS shows you are no longer in the house location. For alerts you can set them for instantaneous or several options for delayed alerts. On the &quot;no subscription&quot; plan you can view the recorded video for 24 hours and then it is wiped. You also have the ability to remove a recording anytime you want using the cloud cam phone app or computer app at https://cloudcam.amazon.com/<br />Integration with Alexa is nice for turning on a camera or asking for a camera live view (if you have fire TV or a compatible Alexa device with a view screen.<br />Got these mainly for when we are traveling so if someone broke in we could contact police and also have a recording we could send the police (both available &quot;without&quot; subscription for 24 hours). Recording starts as soon as motion is detected without any lag time from my testing. I know reading some reviews of other products like blink the lag time prevented capturing a full video of an incident.<br />The thing I like most about Amazon products so far is that Amazon has constantly improving the software and firmware on their devices like echo, fire tv, etc and regardless of the generation of device it gets the update. Some manufactures (Apple) quit supporting updates for older devices (3 years or less old) and push you to buy new and so far that is not the case with Amazon.<br />Well this is a long review for me and I could go on but if you have questions just ask.",5.0,since i already had an amazon account setup was super easy i would say within minutes for each camera it was setup and working i did download the amazon cloud cam app first before i plugged in the camera for setup it has to boot up and get into setup mode which took about minutesbr caught the two cameras i ordered on sale for each which was a really nice price point i would say they are worth the full price after using for a weekbr i had read reviews and many of the downside issues like reconnecting to wifi after and internet outage or power outage seem to have been totally resolved with updates for software and or firmware you can unplug and move to another room and when it boots up it reconnects to wifi same with an internet outage when reestablished it will connect back to the network at least both mentioned above have been my experiencebr picture quality i would assume is mainly a matter of your internet connection to the cloud i live rural and only have a mb dsl service and both cameras work and record to the cloud picture quality is okay but i am sure it would be much better if i had a higher bandwidth like most people that live in a citybr you can setup schedules for when the camera should be on or off you can setup homeaway so if you leave the house the camera will automatically come when your phone gps shows you are no longer in the house location for alerts you can set them for instantaneous or several options for delayed alerts on the quotno subscriptionquot plan you can view the recorded video for hours and then it is wiped you also have the ability to remove a recording anytime you want using the cloud cam phone app or computer app at integration with alexa is nice for turning on a camera or asking for a camera live view if you have fire tv or a compatible alexa device with a view screenbr got these mainly for when we are traveling so if someone broke in we could contact police and also have a recording we could send the police both available quotwithoutquot subscription for hours recording starts as soon as motion is detected without any lag time from my testing i know reading some reviews of other products like blink the lag time prevented capturing a full video of an incidentbr the thing i like most about amazon products so far is that amazon has constantly improving the software and firmware on their devices like echo fire tv etc and regardless of the generation of device it gets the update some manufactures apple quit supporting updates for older devices years or less old and push you to buy new and so far that is not the case with amazonbr well this is a long review for me and i could go on but if you have questions just ask,2691

"I originally purchased a 26 Vizio VA 10T.  I had some initial problems and read the warranty.  On TVs less than 32 inches, Vizio requires that you ship the TV to California at your expense.  I don't think so.  I returned it to Walmart, and then purchased this TV at Sams.  In home service on this one.<br /><br />This TV has much higher quality and workmanship than the 26 inch model.  Excellent PQ, VG sound, VG viewing angle, no glare. .  The cable hookups go in horizontally, while the 26 inch model had vertical hookups.  The vertical hookups would be fine with a wall mount, but were difficult to use on my stand.<br /><br />Cons.  Remote is pretty basic, and the menu is somewhat confusing.  Since this is used with Direct TV, I only use the Vizio remote to change some preferences.<br /><br />Addressing comments  on Walmart purchases.  Consider this.  I initially purchased the 26 inch model.  I paid a pre BF price of $ 248, reg. $ 327-348.  At $ 248, my 3 year extended warranty was $ 19.99.  I wasn't happy withe TV, returned it, and did not have to pay a restocking charge (hello-Best Buy).  I had to open the Box, and remove the TV, to get to and read the warranty. Only then did I find out I needed to ship the TV to California, at my expense, for warranty work.  Even under the Wally 3 year extended warranty, the mfg terms still applied.  So for any warranty work, I needed to ship it at my expense.  I think it stinks that companies don't disclose the significant  terms of their warranty more prominently, prior to purchase.  Their behavior sticks you with restocking fees.  Love this 32 inch Vizio.

"When I pulled this little camera case out of its box, I immediately thought it was going to be too small for my Fujifilm FinePix Z700EXR camera, but it fit perfectly! This is a sturdy, classy, soft-leather case with soft grey suede inside. The little inside pocket for carrying an extra battery is tight and out of the way; I'll probably use it to put identification inside in case I ever leave the camera lying on a table somewhere. With my camera's side strap sticking out of one side (which I prefer to running it through the top hole because access is quicker), it's like a little mini-purse. The cutout in the top happens to be right over the USB cable port on my camera, so if I had to (but I probably won't), I could run the USB cable to it without removing the camera from its case. Another thing I could do if I wanted to is use that little hole to loop an ID tag or small ID/credit card holder through using one of those beaded lamp-pull type thingies. Then I really could travel light.<br /><br />Little things mean a lot to me, and I have to say I just love the magnetic clasp underneath the low-key silverish AmazonBasics logo on the front of the case. The magnet is not so strong as to be annoyingly hard to pull apart, but it's strong enough to do the job without slipping. The little circular magnetic piece in the clasp has a small center button that fits into a recession in the other part of the clasp; when closing the cover, you hear a satisfying little click when you slide it into place, so you know it's snugly closed.<br /><br />I was thinking when I got this (not paying great attention) that the holder ""clip"" on the back was actually a clip suitable for clipping to the edge of your pants or a coat pocket, but it's not. It's actually better than that, because we all know how quickly those clips break off our cell phones. This one closes with strong velcro so you can loop it through a belt loop or other strap or onto a belt. The part of the holder that does not have velcro on it is not quite an inch wide, though, so it wouldn't work as well with wider belts. With the camera in it, it would be too heavy (at least for me) to want to wear around your neck, but you could definitely put it on a lanyard if you wanted to&mdash;and then perhaps stick it in a breast pocket so it's not dangling. One nice thing about the velcro is that, even though it is sewn on very well, part of the piece that is sewn to the camera case actually lifts up as you pull the velcro apart. This should extend the life of the case because you're not pulling against case stitching when you're trying to get it apart. This is not wimpy velcro, so you have to tug a bit to get it open.<br /><br />I really like it!",5.0,when i pulled this little camera case out of its box i immediately thought it was going to be too small for my fujifilm finepix zexr camera but it fit perfectly this is a sturdy classy softleather case with soft grey suede inside the little inside pocket for carrying an extra battery is tight and out of the way ill probably use it to put identification inside in case i ever leave the camera lying on a table somewhere with my cameras side strap sticking out of one side which i prefer to running it through the top hole because access is quicker its like a little minipurse the cutout in the top happens to be right over the usb cable port on my camera so if i had to but i probably wont i could run the usb cable to it without removing the camera from its case another thing i could do if i wanted to is use that little hole to loop an id tag or small idcredit card holder through using one of those beaded lamppull type thingies then i really could travel lightbr br little things mean a lot to me and i have to say i just love the magnetic clasp underneath the lowkey silverish amazonbasics logo on the front of the case the magnet is not so strong as to be annoyingly hard to pull apart but its strong enough to do the job without slipping the little circular magnetic piece in the clasp has a small center button that fits into a recession in the other part of the clasp when closing the cover you hear a satisfying little click when you slide it into place so you know its snugly closedbr br i was thinking when i got this not paying great attention that the holder clip on the back was actually a clip suitable for clipping to the edge of your pants or a coat pocket but its not its actually better than that because we all know how quickly those clips break off our cell phones this one closes with strong velcro so you can loop it through a belt loop or other strap or onto a belt the part of the holder that does not have velcro on it is not quite an inch wide though so it wouldnt work as well with wider belts with the camera in it it would be too heavy at least for me to want to wear around your neck but you could definitely put it on a lanyard if you wanted tomdashand then perhaps stick it in a breast pocket so its not dangling one nice thing about the velcro is that even though it is sewn on very well part of the piece that is sewn to the camera case actually lifts up as you pull the velcro apart this should extend the life of the case because youre not pulling against case stitching when youre trying to get it apart this is not wimpy velcro so you have to tug a bit to get it openbr br i really like it,2631

Over all my experience with the filter holder is excellent. I used the nano pro series. It's all metal. Made of quality materials. It comes the filter holder that will allow you to add 3 filters instead of two. The filter is made of aluminum. I did not want to go plastic I want something that'll last me for many years. Don't buy cheap. The filters that I use from this company are top-notch the nano pro series and the red diamond series. No color casting with their filters. I definitely recommend it it's a little expensive starting out and getting your camera setup for this type of filter system. But you will definitely be pleased in the end. Having a quality product that will last you. I definitely recommend getting the polarizer filter for the holder. It's nice for certain conditions having that polarizer that naturally add apps to this system. Overall I am very pleased with their system. Get it you will be happy. The filters fits snug I used two mm thickness square filters. There's no worry of them sliding out. you can use the lee filters in this system as well. It's not a quick attachment where you pull the lever and pull up the filter holder off. You actually have to screw the filter on. But it allows you to rotate your filter easily. Weather use a solid ND filter or a soft grad or hard edge. You will be able to rotate and slide your filter up and down with ease without the worry of them falling out. Definitely top-notch quality I definitely recommend using the Haida pro series.

"I have used a few different NAS products in the past for my home and business networks, but this Netgear Ready NAS really puts them all to shame. Granted, the cost of this Ready NAS 12 bay model was quite a bit higher than I had paid for any of those other models, but this is really a mile ahead when it comes to storage capacity, performance and reliability.<br /><br />Front and center with this model is the web-based software interface. It reminds me of some of the better UPS software interfaces I have used in the past, with fine tuning and detailed diagnostics available on just about every aspect of the device's operations. The NAS' complexity can largely be safely ignored during normal operations, but if you need to do any advanced troubleshooting or diagnostics the web interface should provide you with everything you need.<br /><br />Initial setup of the device is simple, but not exactly speedy, unless you happen to be starting off with a bunch of unformatted drives of the same, exact capacity. I had six drives to use with this device, which only used up half of the system's total capacity. I initially started the system with just two drives. The software automatically configured the system into a RAID 1 array, which is the only form of RAID available with two drives. As soon as I added the third drive it auto-configured itself into a RAID 5 array. I kept adding drives until I got all six running. In all, it took a bit over 7 hours for all of the drives to sync themselves. I only spent about 5 minutes setting everything up. The rest of the time was spent waiting for the drives to finish syncing. Having configured RAID arrays on both Windows and LINUX servers in the past, I can tell you that it always seems to take forever for drives to finish syncing, but it's perfectly normal.<br /><br />What really impressed me with the initial setup was that I basically just installed a bunch of random mechanical hard drives that I had laying around of various makes, models, capacities and rotation speeds. One of them even had a few known bad sectors on it, but they were all recognized, formatted and synced with no problem whatsoever. I did get a warning about the bad sectors on the one drive, but the system simply worked around them for the time being. Nice.<br /><br />Despite having dual, redundant power supplies and the ability to support up to 12x 7,200 RPM mechanical drives, the system only used around 75 WATTS of electricity with six drive bays occupied. That is amazingly efficient compared to past models I have used. Each PSU has its own power cord and can be pulled out in a hot-swap fashion. The drives can also be easily hot-swapped during normal operations with no downtime. In addition to the 12 drive bays in front, there are also two 2 eSATA ports in the back and 2 USB 3.0 ports. I do not believe that external drives can be added as part of the system's combined RAID array, but they CAN be configured for independent network file sharing. I am not certain what, if any, limits exist on the number of external USB 3.0 drives that can be added and shared. In theory, you could possibly add dozens of additional drives in this fashion using a simple (external powered) USB hub though.<br /><br />On top of the internal and external storage capabilities, the system also supports iSCSI and various cloud drive services including Amazon S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon Cloud Drive, ReadyNAS Backup and ReadyCLOUD.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this device is the number of networking options available via the 4 included Gigabit Ethernet ports. Each port can be individually configured with it's own IP address and/or utilized in a bonded fashion with round-robin, load balancing, failover, bandwidth aggregation, etc. You can also assign ports to different networks and create custom VLANs. Both IPV4 and IPV6 can be mixed and matched on each interface as you wish.<br /><br />The system has a real-time antivrus scanner application included, but from what I can tell this is simply a free implementation of CLAMAV that comes with no documentation or support from Netgear. All that you can do from the web-based interface is turn it on or off and run updates. Turning it on WILL slow down the system. CLAMAV is open source with no heuristic scanning or intelligence to combat zero day exploits, so it should not be relied upon for anything but the most basic protection from known viruses.<br /><br />By far, the most surprising feature that I ran across with this device is the ability to deploy full-blown server applications via something that resembles an app store. Dozens of pre-screened apps are available for download via the web interface and can be easily deployed in a matter of minutes. Most of them are open source. Some fall under different licenses, but they include everything from the latest version of PHP to a full-blown Asterisk VoIP server. Some of the more recognizable apps available are MySQL, SugarCRM, Drupal, DVBlink, Joomla, Logitech Media Server, osCommerce, Twonky and apps to add Bittorrent, surveillance, DNS and a VPN server capabilities. The system already comes with the ability to share files via services such as SMB, SSH, FTP, Rsync, NFS, HTTPS, UPnP, ReadyDLNA, iTunes and more, so these additional apps are just icing on the cake. All of the apps are free, without licensing costs, that I have tested so far.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention here is the product's excellent build quality. Obviously, this product was designed with business and industrial use in mind. It fits nicely into a standard 19&#34; rack and comes with rails, mounting hardware, Ethernet cables and everything you need to get up-and-running with just a screwdriver. There is a one page setup guide, but the rest of the documentation is online.<br /><br />Compared to setting up a Windows or LINUX based NAS server, this product is truly a walk in the park. It's flexibility as a platform is an unexpected bonus on top of its rock solid reliability and construction. It's basically a slam-dunk for any admin that needs to set up a little or a whole lot of network storage with no learning curve and no unexpected feature or hardware restrictions.",5.0,i have used a

"I knew my old projector wasn't that fantastic, but I had no idea just how subpar it was until I plugged in this new 5G 400ANSI/10,000 Lumens, 1080P projector. You might not truly understand all the specs, but trust me, this is the clearest image I've seen next to an actual movie theater image. I did a before-and-after test with the same movie, and it was incredible. It was as if I'd just tried on a pair of glasses I didn't know I needed. Every blade of grass was clear and sparkly, the water rippled, and all the wrinkles and pores on the actors' faces were crystal clear (sorry actors). I pretty much felt sorry for myself that I'd been using my old, blurry projector for so long.<br />You can absolutely use this an outdoor projector, because the picture is so clear and bright, you don't even need to close the window shades when you're watching a matinee. With my entire balcony window open, the projected image is just as vivid on the opposing wall.

I've had this speaker for a couple weeks and I'm happy with it.  It has great sound compared to my exceptionally-quiet Dell laptop.  Good bass too.  I have 2 suggestions for future versions of this speaker.<br /><br />1)  Either make the speaker cord longer or make it a modular connector (male 1/8 mini plug to male 1/8 mini plug).  That way we can choose our own cord length to meet our individual needs.<br /><br />2)  Make the unit take AA batteries for better battery length.  It won't require much more additional space than the AAA batteries currently.<br /><br />3)  Allow the unit to be powered from an external power source such as USB (dual-USB ports if necessary) or an AC adapter.  This would make the speaker useful for long road trips or long durations.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to others.,5.0,ive had this speaker for a couple weeks and im happy with it it has great sound compared to my exceptionallyquiet dell laptop good bass too i have suggestions for future versions of this speakerbr br either make the speaker cord longer or make it a modular connector male mini plug to male mini plug that way we can choose our own cord length to meet our individual needsbr br make the unit take aa batteries for better battery length it wont require much more additional space than the aaa batteries currentlybr br allow the unit to be powered from an external power source such as usb dualusb ports if necessary or an ac adapter this would make the speaker useful for long road trips or long durationsbr br i would recommend this product to others,749

"- I have tried so many different SD cards from various manufacturers, at various price points, in the name of trying to save a few bucks. It was really important to me back when a 128GB card cost $50 or more. They all do the same thing, so what’s the difference, really?<br />What I've found is that it can be extremely aggravating to put up with when the card does not perform well or does not perform at all. I have heard warning stories about cards that are advertised as one size and actually are another size, causing data loss. With that in mind, I have never tried using the very cheapest card or too-goo-to-be-true card deals. But I have purchased cards on sale at the drugstore or even tried some strange brands. What I have come back to is that it’s just not worth the trouble now that prices have dropped so low. When I am trusting 128 GB of data to a single card, it’s just not worth my time and aggravation to have a card that won’t perform. Furthermore, SanDisk cards like this one are all FAST ENOUGH. I’m not a pro photographer, and I don’t have time to figure out whether a card is Class 1 or Class 3 or whatever. I just want it to be good enough that it can keep up with my devices.<br /><br />I have now purchased several SanDisk cards, and each and everyone of them has arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly every time. They are faster than any other card that I use and I've never suffered data loss. I am putting this card into my Fiio X5ii Digital Audio Player, and it works just fine. During the initial data transfer I have already noticed that the speed is adequate, and I never experience skipping when playing uncompressed high-resolution audio files. I have the same card for my Nintendo Switch, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />The prices on these are so good now you have no excuse but to buy good name brand like SanDisk. Just buy it and don't worry about it.",5.0,i have tried so many different sd cards from various manufacturers at various price points in the name of trying to save a few bucks it was really important to me back when a gb card cost or more they all do the same thing so whats the difference reallybr what ive found is that it can be extremely aggravating to put up with when the card does not perform well or does not perform at all i have heard warning stories about cards that are advertised as one size and actually are another size causing data loss with that in mind i have never tried using the very cheapest card or toogootobetrue card deals but i have purchased cards on sale at the drugstore or even tried some strange brands what i have come back to is that its just not worth the trouble now that prices have dropped so low when i am trusting gb of data to a single card its just not worth my time and aggravation to have a card that wont perform furthermore sandisk cards like this one are all fast enough im not a pro photographer and i dont have time to figure out whether a card is class or class or whatever i just want it to be good enough that it can keep up with my devicesbr br i have now purchased several sandisk cards and each and everyone of them has arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly every time they are faster than any other card that i use and ive never suffered data loss i am putting this card into my fiio xii digital audio player and it works just fine during the initial data transfer i have already noticed that the speed is adequate and i never experience skipping when playing uncompressed highresolution audio files i have the same card for my nintendo switch and it works perfectlybr br the prices on these are so good now you have no excuse but to buy good name brand like sandisk just buy it and dont worry about it,1825

"I've used these successfully for many years. Great for quick change off the tripod. Only limit is that it is marked as being designed to hold no more than 6-1/2 pounds.<br /><br />I notice also that as it's spring loaded to secure the base plate to the QRC clamp, it does not attach the camera to the tripod absolutely tight. It's secure, but you can wiggle the camera a bit against the spring.<br /><br />The spring base body comes with a 1/4-20 threaded hole that mounts to the tripod head or other accessory. The plate in the early days went on the camera in only one direction. These days the plate has been reshaped so no matter how you put it on the camera, it will always fit the base adapter properly.<br /><br />To use it, you cock the base place against its spring by pushing in the latch on the left side. It catches in the open position. Then, when you drop the camera into the base, it releases the spring and clamps shut on the plate with a satisfying ""thwunk."" To release, press in the latch and lift. Camera comes free and is easy to remove.<br /><br />While there are dozens of different plates out there from many different manufacturers, and if I were just beginning (and hadn't invested so much in these Stroboframe QRC's) a more universal standard quick disconnect plate system seems to be the Arca-Swiss ([[ASIN:B005ZLOW8K Desmond DAC-01 50mm QR Clamp 3/8"" w 1/4"" Adapter Arca Compatible for Tripod Head]]).

"I just received this camera bag, so I cannot in truth comment on it's water resistance or durability.  I bought this bag for a new FujiFilm X100V camera.  The bag is a good size for a compact camera system. My camera does not accept accessory lenses so I'll only be carrying spare batteries, charger, filters, cable release and SD memory cards.  That will leave me with plenty of room for a few personal items.  The bag appears to be well constructed and durable. It's well padded and includes four Velcro-locking dividers.

"Original(November 25, 2016): If you like listening to bass heavy music, this is likely one of the best $100ish level headphones you can get. Due to it's closed back construction, it keeps all that juicy bass in the headset, and you can crank this baby up quite a bit due to its low power usage compared to higher end audiophile headphones. As many others have stated, the general sound range is decent, but its cranked up for bass for sure, but can do general sound reproduction quite well for $100.<br /><br />If you are looking for proper audiophile entry level headphones, the Audiotechnica m50x would be my suggestion for general and bass heavy music, and the Sennheiser HD 598 are amazing for less bass heavy music, however those headphones are an extra 50% more expensive at about $150ish currently at the end of 2016.<br /><br />Also, if you are wondering how these stack up against Beats headphones... you are in for a mind-blowing experience. The vast majority of audiophiles, even newbies, generally understand that Beats are &#34;bling&#34;, more of a fashion statement than a sign of taste. Beats tends to cram cheapo components in their headphones, they were even caught cramming metal weights into their headphones to give them weight so they would &#34;feel like quality&#34;, and cranks the bass so high that everything else gets completely drowned out. If you dont believe me, then try this, plug in a set of &#34;high end&#34; Beats headphones to an average computer and crank the volume/power up to max, you might notice that the drivers are straining themselves and have maxed themselves, making the sound grainy and tinny, this is a sign that the drivers are low quality or designed for low power use only, now plug in a proper audiophile headset like an m50x and crank it up to max, those, even if they are entry level audiophile headphones, dont sound like they are straining themselves, you get crisp, accurate sound reproduction, even at high power levels. Now if you plug in a set of true high end studio level audiophile headphones, with proper audio equipment and an amp, it would literally be almost exactly like being in the studio with the artist recording the song at that moment, to the point where even people with golden hearing, who can hear the distinct digital differences between tones from electronic reproduction would have trouble telling the difference with completely uncompressed audio with a set of headphones like the Sennheiser HD 800 ($1000 set of headphones designed with the idea of perfect audio reproduction).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Powerful bass (prepare for some epic headbanging)<br />-Majority of sound range is good<br />-No need for an amp<br />-Price (&lt;$100)<br /><br />Cons<br />-Comfort (heavy pressure with on-ear construction to get that seal for good bass, I can only comfortably keep these on for a couple hours at a time)<br />-The stock cord is pretty short (approx 3ft [1m])<br /><br />Update (Feburary 2020): Things have seriously changed in the last 4-5 years in the audio space. Beats were purchased by Apple, and they dont make complete trash anymore, just mediocre bass-heavy overpriced cans. The pricing of Beats headphones are 50-100% higher than what they are really worth if you are going by actual price for performance.<br /><br />After having a chance to finally fix my pair and try them with a decent entry-level 2019 serious DAC+AMP (a Schiit Magni 3 Heresy stack) I am still pretty happy with the MDR-X10/REDs. Bass is pretty heavy, but not super loose, mids and highs are somewhat recessed, highs more so. Vocals will usually be weak-sounding. The resolution is ok. The soundstage is there, but small, not so bad that sounds never leave the inside of your skull, but its small enough that its in your face.<br /><br />I really wish they had an extra slightly longer cable, and if that cable ended in a 1/4 inch. They are incredibly easy to drive, so its easy to use with a phone (with a headphone jack) or straight out of your PC, even compared to my HD598, I tend to need to crank my amp maybe 10-20% more with the HD598 compared to the MDR-X10. There is no need for an amp at all, though they are good enough to be improved somewhat by using an amp.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is still a decent set of cans for a beginner to start their journey into hi-fi headphones, especially if you are a bit of a basshead. They dont do anything that is overtly offensive.",5.0,originalnovember if you like listening to bass heavy music this is likely one of the best ish level headphones you can get due to its closed back construction it keeps all that juicy bass in the headset and you can crank this baby up quite a bit due to its low power usage compared to higher end audiophile headphones as many others have stated the general sound range is decent but its cranked up for bass for sure but can do general sound reproduction quite well for br br if you are looking for proper audiophile entry level headphones the audiotechnica mx would be my suggestion for general and bass heavy music and the sennheiser hd are amazing for less bass heavy music however those headphones are an extra more expensive at about ish currently at the end of br br also if you are wondering how these stack up against beats headphones you are in for a mindblowing experience the vast majority of audiophiles even newbies generally understand that beats are bling more of a fashion statement than a sign of taste beats tends to cram cheapo components in their headphones they were even caught cramming metal weights into their headphones to give them weight so they would feel like quality and cranks the bass so high that everything else gets completely drowned out if you dont believe me then try this plug in a set of high end beats headphones to an average computer and crank the volumepower up to max you might notice that the drivers are straining themselves and have maxed themselves making the sound grainy and tinny this is a sign that the drivers are low quality or designed for low power use only now plug in a proper audiophile headset like an mx and crank it up to max those even if they are entry level audiophile headphones dont sound like they are straining themselves you get crisp accurate sound reproduction even at high power levels now if you plug in a set of true high end studio level audiophile headphones with proper audio equipment and an amp it would literally be almost exactly like being in the studio with the artist recording the song at that moment to the point where even people with golden hearing who can hear the distinct digital differences between tones from electronic reproduction would have trouble telling the difference with completely uncompressed audio with a set of headphones like the sennheiser hd set of headphones designed with the idea of perfect audio reproductionbr br prosbr powerful bass prepare for some epic headbangingbr majority of sound range is goodbr no need for an ampbr price ltbr br consbr comfort heavy pressure with onear construction to get that seal for good bass i can only comfortably keep these on for a couple hours at a timebr the stock cord is pretty short approx ft mbr br update feburary things have seriously changed in the last years in the audio space beats were purchased by apple and they dont make complete trash anymore just mediocre bassheavy overpriced cans the pricing of beats headphones are higher than what they are really worth if you are going by actual price for performancebr br after having a chance to finally fix my pair and try them with a decent entrylevel serious dacamp a schiit magni heresy stack i am still pretty happy with the mdrxreds bass is pretty heavy but not super loose mids and highs are somewhat recessed highs more so vocals will usually be weaksounding the resolution is ok the soundstage is there but small not so bad that sounds never leave the inside of your skull but its small enough that its in your facebr br i really wish they had an extra slightly longer cable and if that cable ended in a inch they are incredibly easy to drive so its easy to use with a phone with a headphone jack or straight out of your pc even compared to my hd i tend to need to crank my amp maybe more with the hd compared to the mdrx there is no need for an amp at all though they are good enough to be improved somewhat by using an ampbr br overall i think this is still a decent set of cans for a beginner to start their journey into hifi headphones especially if you are a bit of a basshead they dont do anything that is overtly offensive,4146

"I selected this mouse with the thought that it would be a good travel mouse. I like the feature set, specifically the ability to recharge the mouse instead of replacing the batteries.

"Overall I'm very pleased with these ear buds. Lots of pros:<br /><br />- very comfortable to wear. I always have ear buds in when working out, and these stayed put through all my cardio work with zero ear soreness.<br /><br />- sound quality is great. I was listening to Friday Night in San Francisco (John Mclaughlin, Al Dimeola and Pco De Lucia) and was amazed at how much of the mid-range sound I was missing using my old ear buds (JBLs). The bass is not boomy, but more than adequate. I found I was able to get better bass sound by changing the rubber tips to a larger size that better fit my ear.<br /><br />- lots of nice touches such as a carrying case that is well designed to protect the ear buds, a selection of rubber ear tips, and even a cleaning tool. It also comes with an airplane jack adapter, but I won't get much use out of that.<br /><br />- outstanding sound isolation. No ambient sound gets in at all. In fact, I had to take one of them out when I was doing road work since I was concerned about not being able to hear cars approaching.<br /><br />My quibbles are minor and mainly relate to the sturdiness of the cabling. It seems pretty thin and may not stand up to the rigors I often put my ear buds through. Too early to tell if this will be a problem, so I didn't subtract any stars because of it.

"Amazon sells this camera alone for $400, so this $400 kit with the camera and a bunch of accessories means the accessories are essentially free. I received the camera quickly and it works great out of the box. The 30x zoom is not a gimmick. I took this camera to the America's Cup yacht races in San Francisco and was able to take clear photos of the individual boats, even when they were miles away from shore. At a baseball game, I can zoom in close enough to read the writing on a baseball bat, even though I am sitting in the cheap seats. You do need good sunlight to use the zoom; results are much less interesting indoors since either high ISO or long shutter speeds will create blurry photos.<br /><br />The zoom isn't this camera's only great feature. The HX50 also takes great macro photos since it can focus sharply on objects (flowers, insects, coins, etc) that are just 1cm away from the lens. This is a great feature for nature photographers (just like the zoom is great for photographing distant wild animals). Sometimes you have to try several time before it focuses on your closeup subject though, especially if their are multiple objects in your scene (like focusing on one flower in a bunch).<br /><br />I'm happy with the camera's WiFi features, though many professional reviews are not. Perhaps that is because I am using an Android smartphone and all the pro reviewers are using iphones. The WiFi works flawlessly for me, allowing me to quickly upload photos to my phone in the field, then post them to the internet from my phone (great for sports and other events). I especially like being able to select individual photos to upload with WiFi. I've used EyeFi in other camera and that really kills your battery because it uploads all your photos all the time. The WiFi in this camera seems to have minimal effect on battery life (if you're only uploading selected photos).<br /><br />I've only tried the WiFi remote control a couple of times and it worked as expected. I can imagine this being useful if you're standing in a crowd at a concert or other event and want to hold the camera over your head (above the crowd) and still compose the scene accurately.<br /><br />The GPS works great, too, at least outdoors. GPS locks on quickly and surprisingly  doesn't seem to have a big effect on battery life (like it does with some other GPS cameras I have owned in the past). GPS is great if you're shooting at a lot of different locations on the same day, especially if you are on vacation and don't really remember where you shot the photo. The GPS coordinates are stored in a standard format in each image's meta data so you can view it using a wide variety of tools.<br /><br />The camera has a ton of modes that may or may not be useful to you. I really like the aperture priority mode, instead of the auto-everything mode. Being able to force the aperture wide open is a really great feature for sports and wildlife photos. An exposure override dial on top of the camera is another really great feature that even many SLR cameras do not have. HDR and panorama modes don't work as well as photoshop, but doing it in-camera is really simple and allows you to immediately post to the internet using the camera's WiFi feature. I don't use any of the ""creative scene"" modes, though those are apparently popular with kids.<br /><br />The main negative for this camera is that image quality is only mediocre, especially compared to Sony's RX100 which packs a big image sensor in a camera that is smaller than the HX50. Packing that sensor into a 30X zoom camera would unfortunately violate the laws of physics, at least with the current state of the art for lens design. If you take a lot of indoors or nighttime photos where the 30X zoom is not real useful, you should look hard at the RX100 which takes much better photos in those conditions.<br /><br />Some people complain about the lack of RAW mode, but realistically this camera does not have good enough image quality for RAW to be really useful. If you care about your image detail enough to want RAW, you should buy an RX100 instead.<br /><br />It is hard to complain about the accessories in this bundle when they are essentially free. However, only the Sony memory card is a name brand item and at only 16GB it is far from Sony's top-of-the-line. The camera case is secured by a small piece of velcro that I don't trust. The tripod is flimsy and not adjustable and probably only useful for indoor tabletop use. The battery is generic with unknown quality. The card reader and screen protectors are very low quality. I wish they had provided fewer accessories that were better quality since I will discard most of these unused, but again I can't complain too much when they are essentially free.",5.0,amazon sells this camera alone for so this kit with the camera and a bunch of accessories means the accessories are essentially free i received the camera quickly and it works great out of the box the x zoom is not a gimmick i took this camera to the americas cup yacht races in san francisco and was able to take clear photos of the individual boats even when they were miles away from shore at a baseball game i can zoom in close enough to read the writing on a baseball bat even though i am sitting in the cheap seats you do need good sunlight to use the zoom results are much less interesting indoors since either high iso or long shutter speeds will create blurry photosbr br the zoom isnt this cameras only great feature the hx also takes great macro photos since it can focus sharply on objects flowers insects coins etc that are just cm away from the lens this is a great feature for nature photographers just like the zoom is great for photographing distant wild animals sometimes you have to try several time before it focuses on your closeup subject though especially if their are multiple objects in your scene like focusing on one flower in a bunchbr br im happy with the cameras wifi features though many professional reviews are not perhaps that is because i am using an android smartphone and all the pro reviewers are using iphones the wifi works flawlessly for me allowing me to quickly upload photos to my phone in the field then post them to the internet from my phone great for sports and other events i especially like being able to select individual photos to upload with wifi ive used eyefi in other camera and that really kills your battery because it uploads all your photos all the time the wifi in this camera seems to have minimal effect on battery life if youre only uploading selected photosbr br ive only tried the wifi remote control a couple of times and it worked as expected i can imagine this being useful if youre standing in a crowd at a concert or other event and want to hold the camera over your head above the crowd and still compose the scene accuratelybr br the gps works great too at least outdoors gps locks on quickly and surprisingly doesnt seem to have a big effect on battery life like it does with some other gps cameras i have owned in the past gps is great if youre shooting at a lot of different locations on the same day especially if you are on vacation and dont really remember where you shot the photo the gps coordinates are stored in a standard format in each images meta data so you can view it using a wide variety of toolsbr br the camera has a ton of modes that may or may not be useful to you i really like the aperture priority mode instead of the autoeverything mode being able to force the aperture wide open is a really great feature for sports and wildlife photos an exposure override dial on top of the camera is another really great feature that even many slr cameras do not have hdr and panorama modes dont work as well as photoshop but doing it incamera is really simple and allows you to immediately post to the internet using the cameras wifi feature i dont use any of the creative scene modes though those are apparently popular with kidsbr br the main negative for this camera is that image quality is only mediocre especially compared to sonys rx which packs a big image sensor in a camera that is smaller than the hx packing that sensor into a x zoom camera would unfortunately violate the laws of physics at least with the current state of the art for lens design if you take a lot of indoors or nighttime photos where the x zoom is not real useful you should look hard at the rx which takes much better photos in those conditionsbr br some people complain about the lack of raw mode but realistically this camera does not have good enough image quality for raw to be really useful if you care about your image detail enough to want raw you should buy an rx insteadbr br it is hard to complain about the accessories in this bundle when they are essentially free however only the sony memory card is a name brand item and at only gb it is far from sonys topoftheline the camera case is secured by a small piece of velcro that i dont trust the tripod is flimsy and not adjustable and probably only useful for indoor tabletop use the battery is generic with unknown quality the card reader and screen protectors are very low quality i wish they had provided fewer accessories that were better quality since i will discard most of these unused but again i cant complain too much when they are essentially free,4587

I have large hands and can navigate pretty easy.<br />6) Quiet - the motor is noticeably quieter than my old Canon SD600.<br />7) Picture quality - excellent as always. I tend to shoot in normal mode with either 12 or 8MP and the quality looks great. This is a point and shoot so you are not going to get vibrant pictures as you do with a DSLR. However the quality is real good so I have no complaints here.<br />8) Zoom - I like the 3x zoom. No problems. I think the digital zoom is okay but then it's not always good on any point and shoot.<br /><br />Video review:<br />1) Great video. It outputs in 720P HD quality. Nice look and feel when viewing on a computer or on tv. HDMI port is a bonus on the camera.<br />2) Only drawback is you can't optically zoom while filming. But then think about the size of the camera - so plan your shots accordingly before filming. You'll get good video clips for the web to share. Not going to produce an oscar-winning film with this :)<br /><br />Overall:<br />What else can I or anyone else say? Great camera for all the features offered for $220. I love the color, red, too. Nice to have a different color than the same old silver or black boring colors.<br /><br />If you are curious about the quality of pictures or video, go to Vimeo or Flicr and do search for SD780.

"I have used and tested more Ethernet cables than I can remember and there is no question, all Ethernet cables are not created equally.<br /><br />Typically any device requiring an Ethernet cable will come with one in the packaging - it will work (usually).  A good comparison is those cables are much like an old car - it should get you there, whereas this cable is like a high end sports car - it will get you there lightning fast, without failure.<br /><br />This Cat8 is thicker than some due to the shielding within and additional insulation.  The connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug.  The connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivity.<br /><br />This Cat8 Ethernet Cable is 50’ long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your TV or gaming system into your router.  So many of us stream programs and movies via our TV and there is no comparison in speed between a WiFi connection and a wired connection.  For gamers, it is absolutely the way to go - do away with all lag caused by your WiFi by connecting directly to your router.<br /><br />You will not find a better 50’ Ethernet Cable - this is really a top of the line Ethernet cable that you’ll love.<br /><br />This is a purchase that you’ll never regret.",5.0,i have used and tested more ethernet cables than i can remember and there is no question all ethernet cables are not created equallybr br typically any device requiring an ethernet cable will come with one in the packaging it will work usually a good comparison is those cables are much like an old car it should get you there whereas this cable is like a high end sports car it will get you there lightning fast without failurebr br this cat is thicker than some due to the shielding within and additional insulation the connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug the connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivitybr br this cat ethernet cable is long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your tv or gaming system into your router so many of us stream programs and movies via our tv and there is no comparison in speed between a wifi connection and a wired connection for gamers it is absolutely the way to go do away with all lag caused by your wifi by connecting directly to your routerbr br you will not find a better ethernet cable this is really a top of the line ethernet cable that youll lovebr br this is a purchase that youll never regret,1335

"I totally love this case. I spent sometime online researching for a good case for my 2015 Macbook Pro with Retina Display. There were three that I picked from. One is of course this one, another one is the iBenzer, and the third one is the Kuzy (not sure if I spell it right). I first eliminated the iBenzer model even when it has the color I want (darker black, TopCase's black is more like dark gray) because the four foots on the back are white colors, which look so ugly and don't match the case, and they feel so cheap. Then I eliminated Kuzy's model (it has a even better black model that looks so much like navy blue color) because the foots are cheap and seem easy to break (just as what other reviewers have reported). I chose the TopCase model and gave it a try. When I received it, I was impressed by its quality (though the color could be darker and more black rather than gray for my black model). It feels sturdy and soft. Not very fingerprint magnet actually. Even when you actually see some fingerprints, you can easily wipe them out with your &#34;fingers.&#34; The color is ok, the material is great, the foots are sturdy and do not look and feel cheap.

"[[VIDEOID:1eb85884aa7e13329b0f003980c03840]] I am beyond impressed with this baby monitor. The picture clarity is unbelievable!! It's 1080P HD, and even the nighttime video and picture is so clear! I love that it's truly wireless. You can leave plugged in or move from room to room. The battery is rechargeable and will hold the charge for up to 6 hours. You can also play soothing lullabies for your baby, change the light colors, and even dress it up (you have to purchase your own accessories to do this, however it's very cool)!! The monitor also sends alerts if there are movements and you can set up as you wish. Using the app and installation is literally a piece of cake! I really wish I had come across this baby monitor sooner as it is the best I have seen! The only thing is that the volume is very quiet when you want to communicate with baby. I am assuming this is done on purpose so it doesn't startle or scare your little one. Also, there is about a 2-3 second delay from real time.

The best purchase I brought. I had to get it cuz someone was knocking on my door and touching the door knob. It was like 3 times. So I got a motion alarm that sounds off if anybody trys to break in and with this door knob alarm it works well with it. If anybody touches my door knob or gets close to my door both alarms sounds off loud. It woke me up a couple of times. There are two different sounds and a switch to turn it off if is annoying. I tell you no regrets. The thing is you have to unscrew the lid to put the batteries in. So get a little screw driver since the screws are tiny. Is ok since is worth the effort to be safe.

"My partner is using this to make his iPad his primary computer, and is very happy. Bought one for a family member,and it also enhanced her use of the iPad. Plan to get one myself, now that white ones are out to match my iPad. No issues with slipping strip that others have complained about. Have to insert the iPad properly. only negative is that I will have to give up my flip back Targus cover/stand when carrying this as a cover, and need a slip case to put them in. The Crown craft case works well.<br /><br />Update 6/2015<br />Have been using the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard cover since 2012, when I received one as a gift. It changed my use of the iPad dramatically, it is now close to a laptop replacement much of the time. Now 3 years into it, it is wearing out. The iPad falls out backward, dangerously so, I have to be sure I don't leave it near the edge of a table lest it fall to the floor. I have always carried or packed the iPad with keyboard cover in an envelope case, and the only damage sustained was when it dropped out of the case to the floor. I do know someone who broke hers when it dropped off of the cover. Haven't put any skin covering on the iPad or case back, the iPad looks good the back of the keyboard a bit worn. The magnetic closure works well enough to position the closed case on the iPad, but I would not say it is strong enough to trust to stay closed.I can't see any magnet holding the iPad into the cover. Although I have been looking for other options, I probably will bite the bullet and get another one of these soon, as it seems to be the best combination of size, weight, usability and protection. Wouldn't consider going without a keyboard again.",5.0,my partner is using this to make his ipad his primary computer and is very happy bought one for a family memberand it also enhanced her use of the ipad plan to get one myself now that white ones are out to match my ipad no issues with slipping strip that others have complained about have to insert the ipad properly only negative is that i will have to give up my flip back targus coverstand when carrying this as a cover and need a slip case to put them in the crown craft case works wellbr br update br have been using the logitech ultrathin keyboard cover since when i received one as a gift it changed my use of the ipad dramatically it is now close to a laptop replacement much of the time now years into it it is wearing out the ipad falls out backward dangerously so i have to be sure i dont leave it near the edge of a table lest it fall to the floor i have always carried or packed the ipad with keyboard cover in an envelope case and the only damage sustained was when it dropped out of the case to the floor i do know someone who broke hers when it dropped off of the cover havent put any skin covering on the ipad or case back the ipad looks good the back of the keyboard a bit worn the magnetic closure works well enough to position the closed case on the ipad but i would not say it is strong enough to trust to stay closedi cant see any magnet holding the ipad into the cover although i have been looking for other options i probably will bite the bullet and get another one of these soon as it seems to be the best combination of size weight usability and protection wouldnt consider going without a keyboard again,1631

"This is SO adorable and so easy to use! It took me less than 5 minutes to follow the instructions and apply this vinyl sticker to my MacBook! These would actually be cute on ANY computer (or, any other project like a picture frame, furniture, mirror, clipboard, etc) and is so easy you can change them up whenever you get the whim. There are no bubbles and it is heavy duty vinyl that sticks well to the surface. The decal was shipped in a large rigid cardboard package to keep it from being damaged and also included a detailed instruction sheet.  There is a cut out of the Apple logo but the decal is there in case you decide you want to use it on something else it is a full mandala.<br /><br />As I was aligning the pattern to the Apple logo on my MacBook I realized I was slightly off in judgement and was able to easily pull it off and reapply it in the right spot.  Definitely better than other brands I've used!  The design and quality are great, you get what you pay for!

"I got into the Meross ecosystem about 6 months ago when I installed the Meross smart garage devices for my two garage doors. Ever since I’ve been delighted with everything they offer. So when I saw they had this smart power strip available, I had to try it. It has been a great purchase and fit my needs nicely.<br />To start, make no mistake, it is larger than your typical (non-smart) power strip, but that’s the trade off for the additional functionality. And really,.. it’s not THAT big. I will say though that it does seem to be built well. The four outlets are individually controllable by app or voice assistant, but the four USB ports are controlled as a group. Not a problem for me, but worth noting. I’ll also mention that the outlets themselves emit an audible ‘click’ when turning on or off, but the USB’s are silent. Again, not an issue, but worth mentioning. Getting it paired with Alexa was easy enough, but I did have a slight problem with it trying to default to Apple Home Kit instead of Alexa. I’m not sure if that’s an issue with this device or Alexa. In any case, it worked fine after a few minutes.<br />Overall I’m very pleased and I’m looking forward to other new Meross products!",5.0,i got into the meross ecosystem about months ago when i installed the meross smart garage devices for my two garage doors ever since ive been delighted with everything they offer so when i saw they had this smart power strip available i had to try it it has been a great purchase and fit my needs nicelybr to start make no mistake it is larger than your typical nonsmart power strip but thats the trade off for the additional functionality and really its not that big i will say though that it does seem to be built well the four outlets are individually controllable by app or voice assistant but the four usb ports are controlled as a group not a problem for me but worth noting ill also mention that the outlets themselves emit an audible click when turning on or off but the usbs are silent again not an issue but worth mentioning getting it paired with alexa was easy enough but i did have a slight problem with it trying to default to apple home kit instead of alexa im not sure if thats an issue with this device or alexa in any case it worked fine after a few minutesbr overall im very pleased and im looking forward to other new meross products,1153

"Pros:<br />The greatest positive attribute of this case is that it holds the Apple Pencil neatly and securely tucked inside the molded plastic portion of the case (vs in a flimsy, elastic loop offered by other models) and it also has a place for the pencil cap and for charging coupler when either are not in use.<br /><br />The grooves built into the cover to hold the iPad up for viewing are well made (deep enough that it doesn’t slip out easily), but the case would be greatly improved by adding a 3rd groove closer to the spine in order for the iPad to sit in a more upright position when in landscape mode.<br /><br />Cons:<br />This is my second case of the same style from the same company (different color way). On the first case, the elastic loop that holds the cover closed began to pull out of shape due to loss of elasticity near one of the attachment points.  (That has not happened with this case.)<br /><br />Also, I found a flaw in the case design the hard way.  I accidentally dropped my iPad (from a low height) while it was in the case.  I am not a clumsy person, but I did lose control of the device while trying to open a heavy door.

"This is a decent PC monitor that doesn’t excel in any area but, at the same time, doesn’t fall flat either (except for sound quality). It’s a good choice if you’re looking for an inexpensive, wide-screen monitor that comes in at under $100.<br /><br />The build quality is what you’d expect at this price point: pretty basic and simple. The casing is all plastic, and rather cheap feeling plastic at that. It comes with a very basic stand that allows a limited amount of tilt adjustment, but no swivel or monitor rotation. There are no mounting holes on the back to facilitate a wall or stand mount. There are also no convenience features, such as a USB hub. It also lacks an HDMI port.<br /><br />On the plus side, the power cord just plugs into the monitor without the need for a transformer or wall wart. The overall monitor profile is pretty slim, and it is very lightweight.<br /><br />Setup is very simple. No tools are needed to attach the stand (just push and it clicks into place). It comes with a VGA cable, a 3.5mm audio cable and a power cable. Although it includes a DVI port, it does not come with the cable to use that. It also does not come with a user guide (other than a one-page quick setup sheet) or a driver disk. Both are available as downloads from the HP site. However, neither are really needed.<br /><br />I hooked it up to my laptop via VGA to use as a secondary monitor. It auto installed under Win 7, so it should be able to do the same for 8 and 10. The recommended resolution is 1600x900 at 60Htz.<br /><br />Right out of the box the settings were eye-searing bright, as is typical with manufacturer defaults since they want their monitors to stand out when on display in a store. Changing the settings is pretty easy – the menu button brings up the full list of options; you select the one you want; then adjust with the +/- keys. You can experiment at will since there’s also a choice to return to factory defaults should you get lost in the weeds with changes. The adjustment menu is pretty extensive for a monitor at this price point. You can adjust the usual brightness and contrast, and also color temp, image control, and even turn off the blue LED power indicator (yes!). Unfortunately, the control button labels are impossible to read (black on black) but there’s only a few buttons, so it's not tough to figure out.<br /><br />The image quality is decent once it’s been properly adjusted. It won’t wow you, but it provides good performance on both images and text. I was happier with the text performance than I was with video (it has pretty limited black levels) but, for an everyday, inexpensive monitor, it’s more than acceptable.<br /><br />The speakers are very, very basic. Tinny to the point of being useless. I’ve gotten better sound out of a $5 set of basic computer speakers.<br /><br />I’m giving this 4 stars since, even at this price point, HP could have done a better job with the overall look/feel of the monitor, have included some additional convenience features such as a swivel, USB hub, and/or an HDMI port. Features that could have been dropped are the internal speakers, which are useless for anything other than to hear system beeps. Still, even as-is, it’s worth considering if you’re looking for a no-frills, no-fuss, inexpensive monitor.",4.0,this is a decent pc monitor that doesnt excel in any area but at the same time doesnt fall flat either except for sound quality its a good choice if youre looking for an inexpensive widescreen monitor that comes in at under br br the build quality is what youd expect at this price point pretty basic and simple the casing is all plastic and rather cheap feeling plastic at that it comes with a very basic stand that allows a limited amount of tilt adjustment but no swivel or monitor rotation there are no mounting holes on the back to facilitate a wall or stand mount there are also no convenience features such as a usb hub it also lacks an hdmi portbr br on the plus side the power cord just plugs into the monitor without the need for a transformer or wall wart the overall monitor profile is pretty slim and it is very lightweightbr br setup is very simple no tools are needed to attach the stand just push and it clicks into place it comes with a vga cable a mm audio cable and a power cable although it includes a dvi port it does not come with the cable to use that it also does not come with a user guide other than a onepage quick setup sheet or a driver disk both are available as downloads from the hp site however neither are really neededbr br i hooked it up to my laptop via vga to use as a secondary monitor it auto installed under win so it should be able to do the same for and the recommended resolution is x at htzbr br right out of the box the settings were eyesearing bright as is typical with manufacturer defaults since they want their monitors to stand out when on display in a store changing the settings is pretty easy the menu button brings up the full list of options you select the one you want then adjust with the keys you can experiment at will since theres also a choice to return to factory defaults should you get lost in the weeds with changes the adjustment menu is pretty extensive for a monitor at this price point you can adjust the usual brightness and contrast and also color temp image control and even turn off the blue led power indicator yes unfortunately the control button labels are impossible to read black on black but theres only a few buttons so its not tough to figure outbr br the image quality is decent once its been properly adjusted it wont wow you but it provides good performance on both images and text i was happier with the text performance than i was with video it has pretty limited black levels but for an everyday inexpensive monitor its more than acceptablebr br the speakers are very very basic tinny to the point of being useless ive gotten better sound out of a set of basic computer speakersbr br im giving this stars since even at this price point hp could have done a better job with the overall lookfeel of the monitor have included some additional convenience features such as a swivel usb hub andor an hdmi port features that could have been dropped are the internal speakers which are useless for anything other than to hear system beeps still even asis its worth considering if youre looking for a nofrills nofuss inexpensive monitor,3115

"These two aluminum light stands came in fabric (nylon?) carry cases that zip up and have an adjustable carry strap. With the stand inside, the case was 29&quot; long by 3&quot; wide. No instructions were included, and I've never used light stands before so I may not have done it correctly. However, the height of the light stand at the greatest extension was 6' 11&quot; and the base was about 23&quot; across with the length between legs at 25&quot;. At the lower heights, the stand seemed stable enough, but I'm not sure it would be if the light was big and the stand fully extended. The legs were easy to extend out to the extension shown in most of the pictures, but they became more difficult to open after that point. The two latches were a bit stiff to work, but they did effectively hold the extended length in place when closed (though this was done without lights attached, FYI).",4.0,these two aluminum light stands came in fabric nylon carry cases that zip up and have an adjustable carry strap with the stand inside the case was quot long by quot wide no instructions were included and ive never used light stands before so i may not have done it correctly however the height of the light stand at the greatest extension was quot and the base was about quot across with the length between legs at quot at the lower heights the stand seemed stable enough but im not sure it would be if the light was big and the stand fully extended the legs were easy to extend out to the extension shown in most of the pictures but they became more difficult to open after that point the two latches were a bit stiff to work but they did effectively hold the extended length in place when closed though this was done without lights attached fyi,846

"At home I use headphones like the Sennhesier HD600 and HiFiMan HE-400 and HE-500 which are audiophile grade along with all the IEM's I used to have.  I wanted a pair of good headphones I could wear when I'm out and about so I looked around.  I was going to get some thing like the Sennheiser HD-25 or something along those lines but wanted something that looked a bit better though I normally don't care as long as they sound good.  I've heard the Beats HP's and they suck as far as SQ but I've read some good reviews about the SL150's by Soul so I took a chance.<br /><br />Build quality wise they're fine and seem built just as good as Beats and others plus they fold down for easy use when traveling.  Now the SQ isn't bad, isn't bad at all.  The bass is very full with good depth but theses more mid-bass but it still sounds clean.  The mids have good detail but not great as well as the treble which is laid back and that I like.  Soundstage is average for a pair of HP's while imaging was good but the separation wasn't great and with complex songs it tends to sound a bit cluttered, though I was expecting that after some reviews from quality sources have said.<br /><br />Over all these are a nice stylish pair of HP's with good SQ and for around $80 to $85 new I think its a pretty good deal.

"I own a Tecsun PL-600 and PL-660 for comparison purposes. Bottom line up front: The Executive Elite is a solid, middle of the road HF portable in my opinion.<br /><br />Build quality: Average to above average. Solid case, but cheap feeling plastic. The buttons have a good feel to them, however, I wish they were backlit. The radio comes with a nice leather case that functions well.<br /><br />Display quality and layout: Above average. The orange on black look is a love or hate thing for a lot of people. I happen like it. It works well in sunlight too. The layout of the letters and numbers is also good, with everything being easy to read. No major complaints.<br /><br />Radio performance: MW = Above average, SW = Above average. Both MW and SW perform well when compared to my Tecsun PL-600 and PL-660. Sensitivity of the executive is on par with the Tecsuns, and Tecsun receivers are generally regarded as being the cream of the crop when it comes to sensitivity among portable radios. My only complaints are that weaker SSB broadcasts tend to come in with very low audio, and that the sync detection is practically useless in most cases. A workaround to the low audio on SSB is to use noise cancelling or noise isolating headphones. I use my Bose QC15's when tuning around on SW/SSB, and they make the listening experience much nicer.<br /><br />Tuning: Marginal to poor. This is, without question, the Elite Executive's biggest weakness. The tuning wheel has significant indents when turning, and there is noticeable muting between frequency changes, making the tuning experience quite frustrating. It's not as bad when the tuning mode is set to fast, and you are browsing the broadcast bands at 5khz increments, but when tuning SSB in slow mode, forget it... It's a tedious process, and to top it off, there is loud pop with each frequency change. When you are wearing headphones, that popping noise becomes even more noticeable, and makes the listening experience rather fatiguing. Compare this to the Tecsun radios, which, IMO, have the best tuners in class.<br /><br />Likes and dislikes:<br />Likes -- Radio has a nice size, display is easy to read, good selectivity, good sensitivity, good performance all around, takes regular AA batteries!<br />Dislikes -- Tuning around the bands is tedious, loud pops when tuning in SSB mode, dust collects easily under the top display piece<br /><br />Worth the purchase?: This is one of the better portable radios with SSB on the market.

I positioned the repeater in a window of the main house, in a way that sneaks through hallways to improve signal throughout the home as well as to the cottage. Previously the cottage was getting .5 download and .25 upload when lucky.  Now we're getting 15 down and 5-6 up.  Enough to stream Netflix.  Yes, a repeater broadcasts a degraded signal, but if you are rebroadcasting a decent signal with a decent speed, all will work well. Try repositioning it until you get the best signal.  Alas, the wifi analyzer tool only works on Android and PC, which is a big bummer for Apple users.  I couldn't get it to work on Win 8, however.  It wouldn't detect networks, so instead I used speedtest to keep checking the speeds to find the ideal placement of the repeater. 4 stars because of the lack of Mac compatibility with WiFi analyzer. The footprint is small, which is great. Fear not, it's powerful antennas will eliminate dead spots.

"I've wanted a pair of bluetoothin ear headphones for a long time.  I have a wired pair that function on bluetooth but they are connected by a wire and hang around your neck, so I was really excited to get my hands on these.<br /><br />First off, the charging case is really nice looking and feels good in your hand, it's a nice weight and it opens and closes very well.  The earbuds will only go in the case one way and the magnet that holds them in is strong and keeps them connected to the case for charging.<br /><br />They charge REALLY quickly both with the battery from the case and when the case is plugged into the wall, and the battery life on the earbuds is REALLY good.  I charged them several times out of the case since I got them and it is still juicing them back up after watching netflix on my ipad for a couple hours a night.<br /><br />They pair really easy and quickly and they sync properly when only using one earbud or when using both of them.  There is no noticeable delay between video and the sound either which is great!<br /><br />Overall these are really nice wireless earbuds. My only issues are that while the right earbud fits very well in my ear, I can't seem to get the left to fit well no matter which rubber fitment cap I use so I'm constantly adjusting that earbud.  The other issue is, the sound is a little too tinnie for my taste.  Not much bass at all, but the sound is absolutely crystal clear and the noise canceling is very good.<br /><br />If you are an audiophile I would say these probably aren't for you.  If you are looking for something that works well has clear sound and great battery life (maybe to use with your phone for phone calls as well) then you can't beat the price and they will certainly fulfill your needs.",4.0,ive wanted a pair of bluetoothin ear headphones for a long time i have a wired pair that function on bluetooth but they are connected by a wire and hang around your neck so i was really excited to get my hands on thesebr br first off the charging case is really nice looking and feels good in your hand its a nice weight and it opens and closes very well the earbuds will only go in the case one way and the magnet that holds them in is strong and keeps them connected to the case for chargingbr br they charge really quickly both with the battery from the case and when the case is plugged into the wall and the battery life on the earbuds is really good i charged them several times out of the case since i got them and it is still juicing them back up after watching netflix on my ipad for a couple hours a nightbr br they pair really easy and quickly and they sync properly when only using one earbud or when using both of them there is no noticeable delay between video and the sound either which is greatbr br overall these are really nice wireless earbuds my only issues are that while the right earbud fits very well in my ear i cant seem to get the left to fit well no matter which rubber fitment cap i use so im constantly adjusting that earbud the other issue is the sound is a little too tinnie for my taste not much bass at all but the sound is absolutely crystal clear and the noise canceling is very goodbr br if you are an audiophile i would say these probably arent for you if you are looking for something that works well has clear sound and great battery life maybe to use with your phone for phone calls as well then you cant beat the price and they will certainly fulfill your needs,1703

As you can see in the attached photo, on iphone se the menu in the app is cut off so you can’t view 5 minute clips, only 30 minute clips. You also can’t fast forward through video. That makes it very hard to scan through recorded video for when motion detection doesn’t cut it, as for my case.

Many similar products are relatively overpriced so at least it is not alone in that sense. That being said the actual product is 5 stars, the price is like 2 or 3 in my opinion)<br />Picked this up at a seasonal brookstone store in the local mall. it was a floor display so i got it 1/2 off, 35$ish.  I bought it to use with an acer iconia one 7 tablet. i was pritty sure it would work fine and it does. i cant use the shell that came with it since its made for the ipad but that's hardly relevant. I also did quite a bit of research on the potential of magnetic cases causing damage and as far as i can tell it wont, and after the few days ive had it, it hasnt. i already have a folding leather case for my tablet so ive been using both that and this, closing them on each other for travel, works fine when folded up like that, i stick a rubber band around them and 'voila'. The point is its versatile.<br />~It seems sturdy enough and by itself is rather light and not bulky. The keyboard stays in the case nicely and can be removed easily.<br />~To pair it is simple, press function and delete while your tablet is searching.<br />~the 'cover' folds in an origami style and supports a tablet, or phone, in landscape or portrait<br />~works with my acer tablet as well as my samsung galaxy 4 (both running android)<br />~case looks sharp<br />~keys feel good and my fingers are getting used to the compact design<br /><br />****this is a follow up to my review above*******<br />UPDATE: the magnetic field CAN effect the operation of a capacitive touch screen. I discovered the issue after i had the tablet in close proximity with the magnetic case, on and off for days. The screen was not reponding correctly to a stylus. The stylus was leaving 'gaps' in lines. even when it was not near the magnetic case. i reset the tablet, cleaned the screen nothing worked until i removed it from its own leather case, who has two 4 magnets of its own. After that it was fine, i put it back in the leather case and it still funtions fine.<br />I believe that the keyboard case magnests somehow interacted with the leather case magnets and the device, establishing enouph of an electromagnetic field to disrupt the touch screen sensors. it is my thought that once the keyboard case was removed the field never actually diminished until i took even the smaller magnets of the leather case away for a moment, even though the leather case had never provided a problem on its own.",4.0,im giving this but i think the price on all of these is a little outrageous i think they are worth about half the asking price many similar products are relatively overpriced so at least it is not alone in that sense that being said the actual product is stars the price is like or in my opinionbr picked this up at a seasonal brookstone store in the local mall it was a floor display so i got it off ish i bought it to use with an acer iconia one tablet i was pritty sure it would work fine and it does i cant use the shell that came with it since its made for the ipad but thats hardly relevant i also did quite a bit of research on the potential of magnetic cases causing damage and as far as i can tell it wont and after the few days ive had it it hasnt i already have a folding leather case for my tablet so ive been using both that and this closing them on each other for travel works fine when folded up like that i stick a rubber band around them and voila the point is its versatilebr it seems sturdy enough and by itself is rather light and not bulky the keyboard stays in the case nicely and can be removed easilybr to pair it is simple press function and delete while your tablet is searchingbr the cover folds in an origami style and supports a tablet or phone in landscape or portraitbr works with my acer tablet as well as my samsung galaxy both running androidbr case looks sharpbr keys feel good and my fingers are getting used to the compact designbr br this is a follow up to my review abovebr update the magnetic field can effect the operation of a capacitive touch screen i discovered the issue after i had the tablet in close proximity with the magnetic case on and off for days the screen was not reponding correctly to a stylus the stylus was leaving gaps in lines even when it was not near the magnetic case i reset the tablet cleaned the screen nothing worked until i removed it from its own leather case who has two magnets of its own after that it was fine i put it back in the leather case and it still funtions finebr i believe that the keyboard case magnests somehow interacted with the leather case magnets and the device establishing enouph of an electromagnetic field to disrupt the touch screen sensors it is my thought that once the keyboard case was removed the field never actually diminished until i took even the smaller magnets of the leather case away for a moment even though the leather case had never provided a problem on its own,2475

"Now, for those who have read previous laptop reviews by me, I am very particular.  Those that get in the 4-5 range are those that meet all the criteria for a very well rounded computer at competitive pricing.  This happens to be one of the few laptops that would be worth considering!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- 15.4"" TFT Screen - 1280x800... not too shabby.  The widescreen aspect makes this a pleasure to view movies as well as every day tasks.<br /><br />- Core Duo - So much better than the Pentium M in terms of performance.  Everything runs much faster!<br /><br />- 2 GB of RAM!!!!!! - You don't see that often in an 1,100 computer, especially one as well equiped as this.<br /><br />- Battery - Average.  I got 2.2 (132 minutes) hours with WiFi (Bluetooth off) on and doing multiple tasks including installing FireFox, Maya, Photoshop and World of WarCraft, and over 3 hours with WiFi off and doing productivity tasks, listening to music.<br /><br />- Graphics Card - Makes this not only Vista Compatible, but also capable of 3D games.  WoW runs without a hitch!<br /><br />- Bluetooth<br /><br />- Integrated camera - 1.3 MegaPixel and rotates 225 degrees<br /><br />- 120GB SATA Hard Drive - THAT'S HUGE for a laptop with a single hard drive<br /><br />- DVD+/-RW DL! - Super Multi-Drive indeed, burns pretty much anything mainstream.  I have not tested the speed of this, but with the specs, I would assume encoding isn't TOO much of a chore like in some of the slower Pentiums.<br /><br />- Tons of ports - Firewire, Infrared, S-Video, DVI-Out, 4 USB Ports!, etc.<br /><br />- XP Pro - no complaint there<br /><br />- 80% One Hour Charge - Great<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- A little heavy<br /><br />- Some competition has better battery life<br /><br />- Although Core Duo, 1.66GHz is the slowest in the line (2.33GHz is the current fastest)<br /><br />- Not the best looking Notebook<br /><br />- Tends to get really warm<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: ALthough not the most powerful notebook on the market, the best in this price range.

"I purchased two [[ASIN:B0036RA5EA Allsop Metal Art Junior Monitor Stands]] for my work monitors. Since I have my own monitor for my other computer, I also wanted a monitor stand for that which is why I ordered this.<br /><br />This one is very nice but it is larger than I expected. It is 20 inches wide (side-to-side) and 11-1/2&#34; in depth (front to back) where as my Allsop stands are  each 14-3/4&#34; x 11&#34; respectively. Had I purchased two of these for my work monitors, I could not fit them on my desk.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this mesh stand is beautifully made and has a drawer that easily slides in and out. The front drawer is protected in back from sliding out the other side. The right side pockets offer additional storage. If one has the room, this stand is perfect.<br /><br />This would have received five stars from me except that it is not level. As you can see in the first picture, one leg is a half inch too short so it tilts back and forth like an uneven chair. However, once the monitor is on the stand, it is not too noticeable. Due to the large size, I am using this to elevate a speaker I have and since it is sitting on carpet, the uneven leg is not an issue for me.",4.0,i purchased two asinbraea allsop metal art junior monitor stands for my work monitors since i have my own monitor for my other computer i also wanted a monitor stand for that which is why i ordered thisbr br this one is very nice but it is larger than i expected it is inches wide sidetoside and in depth front to back where as my allsop stands are each x respectively had i purchased two of these for my work monitors i could not fit them on my deskbr br nevertheless this mesh stand is beautifully made and has a drawer that easily slides in and out the front drawer is protected in back from sliding out the other side the right side pockets offer additional storage if one has the room this stand is perfectbr br this would have received five stars from me except that it is not level as you can see in the first picture one leg is a half inch too short so it tilts back and forth like an uneven chair however once the monitor is on the stand it is not too noticeable due to the large size i am using this to elevate a speaker i have and since it is sitting on carpet the uneven leg is not an issue for me,1109

"Great set of earbuds! Very happy with my purchase. I've never been disappointed with the many products I own from Moshi (i.e. two Versacovers for my iPads, a Sensecover for my iPhone 6+, a laptop sleeve for my Macbook Air). The sound quality is great in my opinion, and a definite step up from many of the factory earbuds that come with smartphones these days. I also really like the color coded earbuds, as it makes it much easier to tell which earbud belongs in which ear.

"this product works as intended and provides good flexibility in terms of power adapters.<br /><br />The following are the things which keep me from giving it 5 stars:<br />1) it is bulky.

Would love to see some way where it can be easily bundled up into a compact form factor.<br />2) It is not silent.

"This tablet comes with everything listed in their description, and is rather nice looking. The camera quality is very poor, but then, on lower priced tablets, that is usually the case. The setup was rather simple, but there was a stickiness to the screen that messed with the touch screen. I do not know if this was from the protective film that covered the whole tablet, but was easily resolved with some cleaner. My only issue with this tablet, is that most streaming apps I can not even find in Google play store. They are not compatible with the device. So if you are getting this for streaming, I would definitely seek out other tablets. Netflix, Disney, Hulu, and a few others could not be added to this. Now, having said that, it downloads just about any game I tried to download, and in the event that it did not, there were still a ton of games that I could. The battery seems to last quite a while, and the picture quality is pretty clear. Volume is decent as well.  The case sits too closely to the screen, and it makes it difficult to use the slide down screens, but, if you are getting this for a child, it makes it harder for them to accidentally mess with the settings, so this is sort of a plus. Overall, this is a decent tablet, and will work just fine for small kids.",4.0,this tablet comes with everything listed in their description and is rather nice looking the camera quality is very poor but then on lower priced tablets that is usually the case the setup was rather simple but there was a stickiness to the screen that messed with the touch screen i do not know if this was from the protective film that covered the whole tablet but was easily resolved with some cleaner my only issue with this tablet is that most streaming apps i can not even find in google play store they are not compatible with the device so if you are getting this for streaming i would definitely seek out other tablets netflix disney hulu and a few others could not be added to this now having said that it downloads just about any game i tried to download and in the event that it did not there were still a ton of games that i could the battery seems to last quite a while and the picture quality is pretty clear volume is decent as well the case sits too closely to the screen and it makes it difficult to use the slide down screens but if you are getting this for a child it makes it harder for them to accidentally mess with the settings so this is sort of a plus overall this is a decent tablet and will work just fine for small kids,1248

"These Jabra Elite Active 45e Wireless Sports Earbuds are comfortable enough to wear and definitely stay put however I can't get them to make a seal in my ears and there are no other tips included. Pairing was super easy which I would expect from a Jabra product. Sound quality is decent for this type of earbud but without being able to seat them snugly in the ear canal, they really do lack in bass. In a quiet room the call quality works great as I had no issues hearing the caller and the caller could hear me clearly. I do like the physical volume control and it is easy to adjust. I did notice some issues with the music dropping out on occasion while walking throughout the house but it was not much different than other wireless buds that I own.

"I put off installing this router because I was trying to get the codes from our ISP, and they are so terrible they never return calls. We've had seriously degraded, sporadically available internet service and have decided to switch providers. (We live on a mountain, facing north, with the mountain behind us, in a small town, so we don't have a lot of options for service. Our current setup involves bouncing off one satellite dish to another, and it doesn't work very well.)<br /><br />Because I figured I couldn't screw up much of anything by trying to install the router using the default codes, I tried that. Setup was simple enough, and it seems to be working a little bit better than the other router we were using (provided by the ISP), but the overall quality of service (not the router's fault) is still bad enough that we ordered through a phone line-based service. (They are shipping a wireless modem to us, so I don't think we'll need this router when it comes. The computer geek of the house says we won't, anyway.)<br /><br />What all of this tells me is that the router is easy to set up and could improve reception. It's got a tidy form factor and simple, easy-to-understand indicator lights. I cannot address the more cutting-edge features of this router (AC) because it's not available to us, but this seems to be a good value for a router if you want to break into AC.

My only complaint is it has a lot bounce if your planning to type on this, and the mouse clicks make it even worse..HOWEVER!! I did find the source of the bounce and it's not the arm itself. It's the laptop tray. Because of how it's design the trey itself naturally flexes from the bent joint (i've circled it in red). As a test I put an object (aka my wall charger lol) as support (also in the picture) and it reduced the bounce by waay more than 50%!!! I'll probably cut a piece of wood to size and add it as support. Great thing is you can leave it in there!<br /><br />Don't think twice - buy it, you won't be disappointed.

"Pros: For a portable mouse it is not tiny for medium/large size hands. Love that there is a scroll wheel on this compared to the touch scroll on my $60 Microsoft arc mouse that can accidentally scroll due to placement of finger(s).  Option for Bluetooth or 2.4ghz wireless.<br />The twist mechanism to flatten the mouse is different but works well for portable storage in laptop cases.<br /><br />Cons:  The charging port hole is at an odd spot underneath the mouse so you can't use it while charging.<br />Not only that but the space around port may not be big enough for micro-USB plugs that have thicker ends.  Also there doesn't appear to be an auto shut off or sleep mode timeout to help save battery.

"I've followed the evolution of Roku's products for a while and recently decided to ""make the plunge"". I researched the popular competitors -- Apple TV, WD, Logitech/Google and decided on Roku although this ""internet - TV"" market is still young and rapidly changing. Back in December, I loaded the Netflix applet on our Wii and signed up for a 30 day trial. I was amazed at the overall quality of the streaming video feed, even at the low 480i resolution. That experience led me to the Roku to see what the higher 720p resolution would look like on our Sony HDTV. Definitely improved but not as much as I'd hoped.<br /><br />From a setup view, the Roku is easy and quick. Doing a bit of preliminary internet research on setting up private channels helped a lot although I'm not impressed with the Roku's channel presentation format -- very basic. Also, the channel content is very limited in quantity and quality, but that's the case for this overall market currently. Very much an ""early adopter"" phase and rapidly changing. I have not yet tested the XD/S's dual-channel wireless ability since I only have a single channel router using 802.11g. However, the wireless communication is more than adequate for video streaming in spite of my router being upstairs and opposite end of house from my HDTV (at least 70 ft and several walls away).<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with Roku XD/S performance and ease of use although I realistically believe that most users would be happy with either of the lower cost Roku products too.",4.0,ive followed the evolution of rokus products for a while and recently decided to make the plunge i researched the popular competitors apple tv wd logitechgoogle and decided on roku although this internet tv market is still young and rapidly changing back in december i loaded the netflix applet on our wii and signed up for a day trial i was amazed at the overall quality of the streaming video feed even at the low i resolution that experience led me to the roku to see what the higher p resolution would look like on our sony hdtv definitely improved but not as much as id hopedbr br from a setup view the roku is easy and quick doing a bit of preliminary internet research on setting up private channels helped a lot although im not impressed with the rokus channel presentation format very basic also the channel content is very limited in quantity and quality but thats the case for this overall market currently very much an early adopter phase and rapidly changing i have not yet tested the xdss dualchannel wireless ability since i only have a single channel router using g however the wireless communication is more than adequate for video streaming in spite of my router being upstairs and opposite end of house from my hdtv at least ft and several walls awaybr br overall im satisfied with roku xds performance and ease of use although i realistically believe that most users would be happy with either of the lower cost roku products too,1449

"I ordered the 'Divoom Pro Premium 40W 12Hour Playtime TWS Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Water Resistant for Indoor/Outdoor Use(Black)' for review.<br /><br />I am a sucker for portable Bluetooth speakers and I had to give this one a go and I must say that I was not disappointed (well maybe just a little - continue reading .....). My first impression when opening the box was that this thing is heavy for how small it is. The speaker itself is a nice size with a beautiful basic design. The controls are really simple and feel very tactile. They are easy to feel which button you are pressing. The speaker comes with really nice braided type cables. One for charging and one Aux cable. Both are quite short however which really isn't a big deal. Especially for the fact that once you fully charge this beast, it'll give you a ""claimed"" 12 hour play time. I have not pushed this limit yet as I have only used it for a couple hours at a time but I have not recharged it yet. Although this speaker has a water resistant rating of IPX5, I have not tested this, but from how this is built, I would feel confident that I could take it outside and not worry about a little Oregon rain or being splashed on by the kids playing in the sprinklers. The really cool thing about this speaker is that you can charge your device while listening to it via the USB type A port.<br /><br />There are only a couple of cons with this speaker in my opinion. First con - Where is the USB C charging? I always have to point this out with new products. This charges via Micro USB.  USB C should be integrated and standard in all new products in my opinion. Second con is that when watching videos there are sync issues. So if you are planning to use this for watching anything video streaming, it gets pretty annoying. This is a new product, and I would think that both USB C and Bluetooth 5.0 should be a standard these days. With that said my overall impression with this Divoom speaker, is that for listening to music it's a beast. It pairs up easily with not much of a delay at all once it has been initially paired to your device. Turn the power on and it'll pair back up fast and ready to play. I also like the fact that if you have two of these (I wish I did) they can sync together to produce a much fuller stereo experience. Maybe down the road I will get a second one and update this review with how well that feature works.

"I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire (8"") when I'm reading in bed in the travel trailer.  I've currently attached it to a shelf in a bookshelf: attaches just fine and is very secure.  I removed the Kindle from it's holder and put it into the clamp: again, attached just fine and appears very secure.  However, when I go to tap on the Kindle, the whole unit wobbles.  Due to the design, this is expected so I may still have to hold the unit when playing games or searching the web.  The main pole that goes to the back of the holder is very strong: had to strong-arm it into position but the end that attaches to the clamp for the shelf is a plastic 'screw' for adjusting the holding clamp and the pole moves within that unit.  I'm going to try sticking some foam into that area as that should adjust the wobble.  Just be aware: might need a bit of modification to keep your unit (like my Kindle) still.  This is why the four stars.  I really like the unit and it will suit my needs perfectly (might get another for home use but it's easily moved about).  Nice not to have to hold the thing when I read as I move about quite a bit when sitting still.

I love this Kindle so far! I have had a Kindle Keyboard(Gen 3) for years and was always skeptical to upgrade because I really liked having the page-turning buttons. Sadly my old one broke just a few days ago :( and I decided to upgrade using Amazon’s trade-in program. The lack of buttons hasn’t been as issue since the page turns based off of which side you touch. Some reviews stated issues with the location of the power button causing it to turn off when holding it with the right hand and I did experience that same issue…. until putting it into the leather case; I have been using it for the past several hours and have had no further issues with the location of the power button. The brightness and warmth adjustment make the screen very easy on the eyes regardless of the ambient light around you. My only complaint is that it is pretty heavy in the case compared to my old model and may cause issues with prolonged use since I have very small hands.,4.0,i love this kindle so far i have had a kindle keyboardgen for years and was always skeptical to upgrade because i really liked having the pageturning buttons sadly my old one broke just a few days ago and i decided to upgrade using amazons tradein program the lack of buttons hasnt been as issue since the page turns based off of which side you touch some reviews stated issues with the location of the power button causing it to turn off when holding it with the right hand and i did experience that same issue until putting it into the leather case i have been using it for the past several hours and have had no further issues with the location of the power button the brightness and warmth adjustment make the screen very easy on the eyes regardless of the ambient light around you my only complaint is that it is pretty heavy in the case compared to my old model and may cause issues with prolonged use since i have very small hands,937

"I recently dumped my consumer grade mesh network for a home built pfsense router and added these AP's along with the OC200 for management.  I have to say that the firmware upgraded has provided a fantastic experience mgt of wifi. Guest configuration including setting up basic captive portal and VLAN is easy. Signal in my home has never been better.  I have 3 AP's covering 3 floors without issue. Stability seems rock solid so far.<br /><br />Will continue to update as time goes on..<br /><br />9/8/2020<br />Still enjoying this product combined with their oc200 and my pfsense NUC. The OC200 makes mgt of your WiFi a breeze. Stability is fantastic and speeds are still rock solid. Roof mounting APs still beats mesh satellites sitting in various rooms. Setting up vlan and configuring a captive portal guest wifi were easy. I would still like to have some  additional reporting  and block functions related URLs at some level. Btw..the people complaining about the inability to get 300 Mg down close range. I get 350 pinned. I'm approximately 10 ft right now from one of my ap's.

More to come...<br /><br />20/27/2020<br />Can't find where my network is being throttled. Short of adding an access point from a competitor, I should clearly be exceeding 300 mb. The POE switch is a GS108PEv3, I have router with 1 gb ports (physical connection gets close to 1gb) and cat 6e cable throughout.  I have to assume it's something to do with the AP's.

The pen holder is not a pen holder.  it is a piece of sticky tape that will not stick to the keyboard.  However, It has stuck to my bedside table.

"For the price I paid (under $40 for an open box pair) I think they sound really good. Though the marketing says they're bass heavy, I'd say they're more of a neutral can with a slight V sound. Mids are a little recessed compared to the lows and highs but it's not a sharp V. Detail and imaging is okay (probably not the best gaming cans), soundstage is pretty narrow. I don't need an amp for these. With my macbook pro they'll got ear piercingly loud at about 80% volume.<br /><br />The bad (for me) is the cable is way too long, they don't fold (so not portable), the pads are very stiff and they get hot quickly and aren't comfortable for very long.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think if these cans disappeared tomorrow I wouldn't buy them again, since I don't think they're very good portable cans but I'd prefer something that sounds better for home use. But if you don't want to use headphone amps and aren't looking for a portable headphone, I think these will work perfectly fine.",4.0,for the price i paid under for an open box pair i think they sound really good though the marketing says theyre bass heavy id say theyre more of a neutral can with a slight v sound mids are a little recessed compared to the lows and highs but its not a sharp v detail and imaging is okay probably not the best gaming cans soundstage is pretty narrow i dont need an amp for these with my macbook pro theyll got ear piercingly loud at about volumebr br the bad for me is the cable is way too long they dont fold so not portable the pads are very stiff and they get hot quickly and arent comfortable for very longbr br ultimately i think if these cans disappeared tomorrow i wouldnt buy them again since i dont think theyre very good portable cans but id prefer something that sounds better for home use but if you dont want to use headphone amps and arent looking for a portable headphone i think these will work perfectly fine,925
"This is a decent, inexpensive webcam that does the job when it comes to video chatting and such. It comes delivered in a tiny cardboard box and does not have much in the way of instructions. It has no software that comes with it and no real user manual. Fortunately, the product is pretty much plug-and-play for Windows 10. I have not been able to test the product on other operating systems though. In Windows 10 at least the device is automatically recognized and the proper drivers are downloaded unless they are already installed on your computer.<br /><br />There is no real configuration of the camera that you can do. It has a fixed camera that you can adjust in position to get the best picture. This camera does seem to need plenty of light in order to get a good image. Without adequate lighting the picture gets grainy and difficult to see. There could perhaps be some software option for fixing this problem in high-end webcam apps but you can't really do much for it in programs like Skype or Facebook IM.<br /><br />To be sure, this is an inexpensive camera that produces less than professional results. If you are just using it for video chatting it is just fine. You definitely would not want to use this to produce professional videos for use on a service such as YouTube though.",4.0,this is a decent inexpensive webcam that does the job when it comes to video chatting and such it comes delivered in a tiny cardboard box and does not have much in the way of instructions it has no software that comes with it and no real user manual fortunately the product is pretty much plugandplay for windows i have not been able to test the product on other operating systems though in windows at least the device is automatically recognized and the proper drivers are downloaded unless they are already installed on your computerbr br there is no real configuration of the camera that you can do it has a fixed camera that you can adjust in position to get the best picture this camera does seem to need plenty of light in order to get a good image without adequate lighting the picture gets grainy and difficult to see there could perhaps be some software option for fixing this problem in highend webcam apps but you cant really do much for it in programs like skype or facebook imbr br to be sure this is an inexpensive camera that produces less than professional results if you are just using it for video chatting it is just fine you definitely would not want to use this to produce professional videos for use on a service such as youtube though,1257
"This product gets 5 stars from me for peace of mind.  Does it have flaws? Yes,  but nothing I can't deal with.  Some of them include- touchy motion detection,  low level quality for night vision and sound quality is hit or miss. I've changed my motion settings multiple times so it is pretty much on my front porch and still, cars are setting it off. My house is set far enough back from our quiet street that this should not happen.  It is better now,  but does continue to occur daily.  As for night vision,  I must have my porch light on or the image quality is very poor and limited to about a foot from the doorbell. As for sound quality, it is not easy to have even a brief conversation, like they show in the commercials. The person at the door is easy to hear but they have difficulty hearing you, at least,  that's what we found in our tests.  Despite all of this,  the peace of mind it comes with is well worth the minor inconveniences.  I wish that I would have purchased this sooner.

"I have a love/😕relationship with my new kindle... I love everything about it except (&I knew this going into the purchase) it has no back up light. HOWEVER... with that being said, the reason I got it was to see it it helped with my eyes. I don't know how many suffer from quivering eyes after they read or work with a cellphone or reader with a back light, but I do and no matter what type of reader (& I've got lots of them) I tried, I still suffered from quivering eyes. So for the first time I decided to try one without a back light. From the first time I used my new kindle I have not suffered from quivering eyes (unless I read for more than 3 hrs) until I bounce back & forth between it and any device that has a back light. Makes driving so much more fun. I don't have to give up driving for reading or vice versa.  In the past if I had to do a lot of driving I would not read any of my ebooks... and I read so much, I'd have to take 5 or 10 books with me any time I traveled.  That's why I started using e-readers.. to be able to bring all my books in a small space. So yes, I love my new kindle but I miss the back light that was causing me so much trouble... grin ... but I don't miss the quivering eyes.",4.0,i have a loverelationship with my new kindle i love everything about it except i knew this going into the purchase it has no back up light however with that being said the reason i got it was to see it it helped with my eyes i dont know how many suffer from quivering eyes after they read or work with a cellphone or reader with a back light but i do and no matter what type of reader ive got lots of them i tried i still suffered from quivering eyes so for the first time i decided to try one without a back light from the first time i used my new kindle i have not suffered from quivering eyes unless i read for more than hrs until i bounce back forth between it and any device that has a back light makes driving so much more fun i dont have to give up driving for reading or vice versa in the past if i had to do a lot of driving i would not read any of my ebooks and i read so much id have to take or books with me any time i traveled thats why i started using ereaders to be able to bring all my books in a small space so yes i love my new kindle but i miss the back light that was causing me so much trouble grin but i dont miss the quivering eyes,1154

I got this tablet to replace my Asus memo 7.  I loved the asus until it started to have a persistant restart loop.  It would run for a while then restart for weeks on end.  Then it wouldnt crash for months on end.  Anyway i needed a small tablet with a decent amount of memory.  After months of hemming  and hawing and endless research I finally settled for this tablet.  I bought a open box one from amazon warehouse.  Tablet was perfect except they forgot to include the tool to open the memory card slot (thankfully a 0.5mm mechanical pencil tip will work).  Tablet fired up and google ttansfered all the data from my old tablet.  All went well and transfers were fast.  Tablet works well and is very fast.  Memory is not all bogged down with unwanted apps (less than 10 gigs used up).  I did clean and disable a bunch of stuff I dont want or use.  It took me a couple hours to get used to the nougut interface and get things squared away.  Battery life is great as i use the tablet for a good 6 hours and levels are still above 50%.  Need to work out the slow charge issue as charging overnight only brings me up to 94%  Im guessing its my powerbank.  Last night there was an update pushed out and this morning im showing the tablet no running Oreo sso thats a nice little bonus.  Camera is meh as is the sound.  The unlit soft keys is a real annoyance.  Samsung dropped the ball on that one and it warrents removing a star.  Also noticed there is no auto brightness featurse.  Thats a bummer.  Sound is poor for this level of tablet but that seeems par for the course in samsung tablets (our family owns 4 of them from a 2nd gen tab 2 to this one)  I dont use the tablet for music anyway and use headphone for watching vids.  Tablet is slippery so a good case is a must.  Screen does a decent job of hiding fingerprints but Im putting a tempered glass protector on it asap.  Tablet runs cool and even charging the temp never really climbs.  About the only thing I would change other than the other mentioned areas is the removal of all the samsung bloatware.  Its not a ton but its takes up space and I wont be using it so it stinks it cant be removed or at least disabled.  All in all im pretty happy and like having a tablet that doesnt reset every 45mins.,4.0,i got this tablet to replace my asus memo i loved the asus until it started to have a persistant restart loop it would run for a while then restart for weeks on end then it wouldnt crash for months on end anyway i needed a small tablet with a decent amount of memory after months of hemming and hawing and endless research i finally settled for this tablet i bought a open box one from amazon warehouse tablet was perfect except they forgot to include the tool to open the memory card slot thankfully a mm mechanical pencil tip will work tablet fired up and google ttansfered all the data from my old tablet all went well and transfers were fast tablet works well and is very fast memory is not all bogged down with unwanted apps less than gigs used up i did clean and disable a bunch of stuff i dont want or use it took me a couple hours to get used to the nougut interface and get things squared away battery life is great as i use the tablet for a good hours and levels are still above need to work out the slow charge issue as charging overnight only brings me up to im guessing its my powerbank last night there was an update pushed out and this morning im showing the tablet no running oreo sso thats a nice little bonus camera is meh as is the sound the unlit soft keys is a real annoyance samsung dropped the ball on that one and it warrents removing a star also noticed there is no auto brightness featurse thats a bummer sound is poor for this level of tablet but that seeems par for the course in samsung tablets our family owns of them from a nd gen tab to this one i dont use the tablet for music anyway and use headphone for watching vids tablet is slippery so a good case is a must screen does a decent job of hiding fingerprints but im putting a tempered glass protector on it asap tablet runs cool and even charging the temp never really climbs about the only thing i would change other than the other mentioned areas is the removal of all the samsung bloatware its not a ton but its takes up space and i wont be using it so it stinks it cant be removed or at least disabled all in all im pretty happy and like having a tablet that doesnt reset every mins,2172

It is easy to take pictures, but for all other operations you need to read the instructions manual. The picture quality is reasonable for a kid, but it is little grainy as shown in the attached files. This instant print camera uses thermal printer technology that enables kids to take photos/videos & print photographs within seconds for coloring. The prints are black and white, and the coloring option is cool. It is a creative tool and inspires kids for imagination and artistry. There are five classic filters, eight special effects, and 20 cute cartoon frames. On the con, the camera prints every single shot without the option to discard pictures captured. I used the default settings; the video resolution at 1080p, camera resolution at 12mega pixel, and print mode at “Grey Print.” Some of the prints are shown here.

"There are probably a ton of digital cameras that have much better quality for the price. However, I thought this instant camera would be neat to try out. I received it just before going on a trip and we got some great pictures at the beach and throughout the town. I discovered that it is best for close(r) proximity and must be used on the appropriate setting. We took about 40 photos in all and put them in a photo book. I was happy with most of the pictures although a couple were washed out or dark. This is a cool camera to have around and having the instant gratification on photo is nice. The quality that you give up for the convenience is worth it in certain situations. I have seen other reviews that mention using them for various events and I can see why.

"This sound bar does have excellent sound. I did have problems getting it to connect. You have to use the HDMI cord they provided. We tried using an extra long one we already had so we didn’t have to hang it under the TV but it would work with other HDMI cords.

Volume control works with your TV control or the remote that comes with it once you have it set up correctly. This is our second sound bar we have had.

"We purchased this digital frame as a shared sibling gift for my parents who are in their mid 80's. Very simply to use (important!) - they won't use the remote or all of the other functions (playing videos, music, etc.). The frame presents very clear pictures. We bought a 2 GB sandisk to go with the frame, and it holds a lot of pictures. Only surprise is that the frame won't show TIF files - we had taken a number of very high definition photos which the camera had recorded in a TIF format.

"My daughter and I set this computer up yesterday so my review is not based on weeks/months use of it.  However, I can probably tell you some things that might be good to know.  First of all, I am NOT computer techy and will not delve into the specs.  Besides, all that is already listed in the product description.  It runs on Windows 10, 64-bit. I'm not super-fond of any Windows platform for privacy reasons, but overall it seems to function well with few problems thus far.<br /><br />The set up was very easy.  Actually the most difficult part was clearing away the previous computer and all it's various components.  There is no separate CPU which I find to be absolutely delightful.  I actually have a nice, open space on the floor where the old one sat.  The CPU is inside the monitor, as well as the DVD drive.  It comes with all the cords you need, including a wireless mouse and keypad.  I was surprised that the sound from the monitor was much better than any other monitor with speakers I've ever used. It wasn't nearly what an audiophile would want, but good enough for basic listening needs.  I still attached my separate sound system because I love really good sound.  The Bluetooth function connected quickly to all my devices.<br /><br />The colors are vivid and defined, the monitor can be angled for different views, and everything is adjustable.  The included instruction showed a base plate for the monitor but mine did not have one.  The monitor stands just fine none-the-less.  The DVD drive is mounted on the right-side of the monitor and seems to work very well.  We had this up and running in about 20 minutes and we were moving kind of slowly.<br /><br />What did not work at all was the Netflix app.  It needs to be uninstalled and re-installed from the Google Play Store.  It will give an error code but it was an easy fix.  The Cortana feature on this computer only works when the computer is initially booted.  Afterwards it fails to hear although I have gone through the mike wizard set-up several times.  I don't know what is wrong with that but it might be something most people would like have working well.  Also, the mouse &#34;copy/paste&#34; function doesn't work. It will copy but you have physically hit &#34;control V&#34; to get it to paste.  It seems to be fast - it moves from webpage to webpage rapidly, movies and videos have yet to glitch, and......it' so quiet.  My previous computer was noisy all the time.  This one is so very, quite.....no cpu sounds at all.<br /><br />Overall so far:  I like it, I wish the Cortana worked like it's supposed too, it's fast and the monitor is large and clear.  Also it's touch screen so you can just touch any app on it to open it up. I'm actually to lazy to lean that far and prefer to use my mouse, but it seems to be a reliably working feature.  However, the touch screen makes it really easy and fast to delete a bunch of pictures.  I had a LOT of pictures from my kid's various science projects that I no longer needed and just touching the screen marking them for deletion was about 20x faster than using a mouse. I will definitely update this review as I use this computer more.  If anything malfunctions or is super wonderful I'll report back.  As of this review this computer costs $729.99.  It also has many various ports on the sides and rear and are very easy to access.",4.0,my daughter and i set this computer up yesterday so my review is not based on weeksmonths use of it however i can probably tell you some things that might be good to know first of all i am not computer techy and will not delve into the specs besides all that is already listed in the product description it runs on windows bit im not superfond of any windows platform for privacy reasons but overall it seems to function well with few problems thus farbr br the set up was very easy actually the most difficult part was clearing away the previous computer and all its various components there is no separate cpu which i find to be absolutely delightful i actually have a nice open space on the floor where the old one sat the cpu is inside the monitor as well as the dvd drive it comes with all the cords you need including a wireless mouse and keypad i was surprised that the sound from the monitor was much better than any other monitor with speakers ive ever used it wasnt nearly what an audiophile would want but good enough for basic listening needs i still attached my separate sound system because i love really good sound the bluetooth function connected quickly to all my devicesbr br the colors are vivid and defined the monitor can be angled for different views and everything is adjustable the included instruction showed a base plate for the monitor but mine did not have one the monitor stands just fine nonetheless the dvd drive is mounted on the rightside of the monitor and seems to work very well we had this up and running in about minutes and we were moving kind of slowlybr br what did not work at all was the netflix app it needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled from the google play store it will give an error code but it was an easy fix the cortana feature on this computer only works when the computer is initially booted afterwards it fails to hear although i have gone through the mike wizard setup several times i dont know what is wrong with that but it might be something most people would like have working well also the mouse copypaste function doesnt work it will copy but you have physically hit control v to get it to paste it seems to be fast it moves from webpage to webpage rapidly movies and videos have yet to glitch andit so quiet my previous computer was noisy all the time this one is so very quiteno cpu sounds at allbr br overall so far i like it i wish the cortana worked like its supposed too its fast and the monitor is large and clear also its touch screen so you can just touch any app on it to open it up im actually to lazy to lean that far and prefer to use my mouse but it seems to be a reliably working feature however the touch screen makes it really easy and fast to delete a bunch of pictures i had a lot of pictures from my kids various science projects that i no longer needed and just touching the screen marking them for deletion was about x faster than using a mouse i will definitely update this review as i use this computer more if anything malfunctions or is super wonderful ill report back as of this review this computer costs it also has many various ports on the sides and rear and are very easy to access,3178

"Please note if you need to know the probable full cost.  You cannot charge the battery on your computer with the USB cable.  Garmin Express does not recognize this product.  (I know...hard to believe).  A typical wall charger does not have enough power to charge the battery with a USB cable.  You need a Wi-Fi connection to update maps and the time required can be longer longer than the battery life.  CONCLUSION;  you need a special wall charger.  If you stream music from your phone to your car’s speakers, the Garmin Smartphone app used for traffic and other features may prevent music streaming.  If so, Garmin’s HD Traffic cable will be necessary if you want both.

"Much has already been said about this device so I will keep my comments brief. This was a replacement for a Kindle Keyboard I've had and enjoyed for years. I'm happy I made the switch. I find it easy to use, and when reading it's just as seamless as turning the pages of a paper book - once you are used to the controls the device itself fades into the background, which is the point. I do find that sometimes the touchscreen seems a little finicky; occasionally it doesn't register a tap for a page turn, or turns more than one page at a time, but this is a pretty minor thing. The other thing that sometimes gets annoying is that, for whatever strange reason, it is too easy to change the font size with a random bump on the screen. Maybe it's just me but if I carry the device with the cover open and my hand slips onto the screen it just seems to always go to the change font menu and I end up with a screen of wonky-sized text.",4.0,much has already been said about this device so i will keep my comments brief this was a replacement for a kindle keyboard ive had and enjoyed for years im happy i made the switch i find it easy to use and when reading its just as seamless as turning the pages of a paper book once you are used to the controls the device itself fades into the background which is the point i do find that sometimes the touchscreen seems a little finicky occasionally it doesnt register a tap for a page turn or turns more than one page at a time but this is a pretty minor thing the other thing that sometimes gets annoying is that for whatever strange reason it is too easy to change the font size with a random bump on the screen maybe its just me but if i carry the device with the cover open and my hand slips onto the screen it just seems to always go to the change font menu and i end up with a screen of wonkysized text,910
"OK, the thing people need to take into account here is that these Cyyber Acoustics ACM-70 Headphones are extremely cheap (price). I paid only about $7 here on Amazon for them.<br /><br />If you're looking for high-quality sonics, amazing music listening, rich bass, or extreme quality, these are not for you.

"Thank you B&O for sending these H8i headphones almost fully charged.  I jumped right into the setup and am listening to various genres of music as I write this.<br />Begin by downloading the app.<br /><br />The scant instruction manual is almost useless unless you want to learn 17 different languages.  (I actually found it interesting to see how each paragraph looked in other languages.)  Download the manual from the app if you need more than the poorly labeled drawings provided or tire of looking for the sentences written in a language you can comprehend.<br /><br />Pairing to my Samsung phone was simple and took a little over a minute.<br />I had a friend call me and we agreed that our voices were very clear; most likely due to the dual microphone setup.  As with any headphone system it takes a time or two to get used to the controls; a quick push of the center button to answer then hold the same button for a couple of seconds to hang up.<br /><br />The noise cancelling trait is pretty darned good.  While listening to a country tune at a medium low level I cranked up the TV.  When I could barely hear any TV noise I then turned the noise cancellation off and was surprised at how high the TV volume actually was.  As much as I love my ancient (1st Gen) BOSE ANC headphones, the Bang & Olufsen headphones are slightly better at cancelling nearby environmental noise.<br />I find the sound quality to be good, but was truthfully expecting it to be better.  I have 2 other pairs of headphones and would say the sound quality of these B&O’s are not much better than my Panasonic Wireless Retro Over-the-Ear headphones or Audio-Technica Wireless Over-the-Ear headphones.  In fairness, I am not an audiophile, therefore my opinion on sound quality may not carry much weight.  Plus over the ear vs. on the ear are inherently different in how sound reaches the inner ear.  The B&O’s have crisp treble, clear mid-range and solid bass.  Perhaps the brand (B&O) raised my expectations.<br /><br />I appreciate the 30 hour battery life.  No more getting upset with myself because I forgot to charge them over night every night.<br /><br />I have one complaint, the headband is uncomfortable.  Almost too heavy so it slips if I turn too fast or lean back quickly.  The fabric housing the padded underside of the headband is woven and pulled so tightly that it becomes somewhat slippery.

"I purchased these to use at the gym. At first, they worked great. Then, when I began sweating, they kept falling out of my ears. That continued through the rest of my workout when I was lifting weights. They only send a few other sizes of plugs. The others were worse. I couldn’t keep them in when I barely moved. At first, I didn’t like the sound quality because there is so little bass. After awhile I decided it was ok for the price. I just can’t use them.<br /><br />UPDATE: Anker has exceptional customer service . After reading my review, they sent the soundcorp Spirit X for me to try. It’s similar, but with an over the ear piece for a more secure fit. It’s great!!! It stays in place, has a great sound, is easy to use, and has a long battery life.

"Just needed a throwaway pair of headphones, was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I like the angled plug<br /><br />The foam eartips are very comfortable (very similar to the nice comply TX-100 eartips)  and isolate very well. The two silicone options are also very good, but a few more tips would have been nice, even if it cost a dollar more.<br /><br />They're quite light and don't weight down your ears.<br /><br />I like the over ear wire, it's very unintrusive. I find the ones with little wire ear pieces to get REALLY painful, but the thin, light wire is completely unnoticeable.  instead of the earpiece, it has a tiny brass weight that just holds the wires down, which winds up working REALLY well.<br /><br />I don't plan on using them for workouts, but if I were, the only thing I'd want is a chin cinch. That's the only thing these are missing. Running is probably fine, but if you're a jumpy crossfit type, you might be able to bounce the wires off your ears.<br /><br />The fit and finish is quite nice, though the parts are built down to a price. Not the greatest wire, but it seems serviceable, there's good stress relief on the plug and Y, and there's no rough or sharp edges.<br /><br />The sound quality is exceptional. I'd say that I have a hard time telling these apart from my $100 klipsch IEM's. It's a nice moderate tone, there's plenty of base but it's not muddy or overhwhelming. Very tight and clean. The mids are the only place you can hear any faltering, and it's just a TINY bit muted. Highs are plenty clear and clean. And that's without any burn-in.<br /><br />Can't speak to the in-line mic, but it responds to google voice commands just fine. It's just a one-button remote, so you only have a pause/play option. No volume control. double click it to skip a song, hold to enable voice commands, Voice commands can be used to set volume, but it's more than just a click.<br /><br />My only four small gripes are the small number of earpieces (the foam tips do kinda make up for it, but the other two are great if they fit your ears. I have medium sized ear-canals and the smaller silicone tips are perfect), I wish it had volume controls on the mic, a chin cinch for exercise, and that it doesn't come with a case of any sort. I'd have gladly paid an extra few bucks for those things.<br /><br />Also not great option for motorcycle helmets, they stick out a little far for that.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these though.

"I was looking for a solution to power passive bookshelf speakers from my laptop.

We had tried at least six different remotes and were constantly getting calls that the television wasn't working.  This has proved to be a lifesaver!

"I love my Doss Soundbox Touch and thought I could connect the Soundbox Pro for TWS (True Wireless Stereo), but learned the two different models cannot connect to each other.

We tried to connect my original speaker to Alexa, but could not.

"The webcam provides a good view of the speaker, better than an old Logitech model it replaced.  I got it to use when I give an invited lecture to a scientific organization, which is having its meeting ""virtually"" this year, so I am glad to have it.<br />There are a few annoyances with this webcam, however, hence only 4 stars.  One is that much information was provided on getting started and trouble-shooting.  So I spent a fair amount of time trying to be sure I was doing the set-up correctly.  However, as it turned out, I did not actually even need to do much at all!  Setting up with my desktop computer running Windows 10 was basically automatic.  And it was difficult to read the tiny print on the printed instruction booklet that came with the webcam.  Also, although the ring light is a nice feature, and easy to turn on and off and change brightness, you have to be careful using it, or it puts too much light in one area.",4.0,the webcam provides a good view of the speaker better than an old logitech model it replaced i got it to use when i give an invited lecture to a scientific organization which is having its meeting virtually this year so i am glad to have itbr there are a few annoyances with this webcam however hence only stars one is that much information was provided on getting started and troubleshooting so i spent a fair amount of time trying to be sure i was doing the setup correctly however as it turned out i did not actually even need to do much at all setting up with my desktop computer running windows was basically automatic and it was difficult to read the tiny print on the printed instruction booklet that came with the webcam also although the ring light is a nice feature and easy to turn on and off and change brightness you have to be careful using it or it puts too much light in one area,895
"Pros:<br />1) Can give temporary codes to others.<br />2) Can designate specific time/day that guest codes work.<br />3) Remote control of your deadbolt lock via iPhone/Android app or web interface ($0.99/month)<br />4) Receive text and/or e-mail alerts when a guest enters their code with their name (additional $0.99/month).<br />5) Runs on AA batteries that last pretty long (based on settings)<br />6) No $100 Zwave or Zigbee hub needed like Schlage and other remote deadbolts.<br />7) No compatible phone needed to grant others access.<br />8) Can create an automatic lock/unlock schedule (for example, to lock automatically at 10pm each night)<br />9) Can create group schedules for guest codes.<br />10) Subscripton not required if you don't need remote features.<br />11) Quality construction and finish.<br />12) Easy installation.<br />13) Consolidated app if you use their other products.<br />One app to control remotely control your lock, thermostat, webcam, outlets, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) App has limited functionality. Just locks and unlocks the door remotely.<br />2) Must use web interface to create new guest codes and manage the lock remotely.<br />3) App isn't the most reliable/consistent.<br />4) Notifications are sometimes delayed/dropped (rarely)<br />5) Yet to be determined if it will work with home automation schemes.<br /><br />I purchased this WiFi deadbolt keypad before it was released to the general public, so I don't pay any subscription fees (Kickstarter). I hate subscription fees, but a buck or two a month is a small price to pay for the convenience this thing provides. I give my neighbor a code when I am working long days and she lets my dog out for me when I am gone. I get a text, so that I know things are taken care of. Priceless. I used to frequently forget to lock the door when I leave the house, so its nice to be able to check its status remotely and close it if one forgets or put it on a schedule to remotely lock itself automatically. As mentioned in the Pro's, you can assign different people different codes so that when they enter their code, you get a notification that that person unlocked the door. Notifications can be delayed or dropped infrequently, but it does happen. You can view a log history of who unlocked the door when and when it was locked. You can also view a &#34;last 3 heartbeat&#34; of the last three times the lock updated its status to LockstateConnect's servers.<br /><br />This brings me to battery life. You can decide how often the lock connects to WiFi. If WiFi is on continuously, it would drain the AA batteries in a couple days. I would recommend to have it update continuously ONLY when you are first setting it up, so that you can test operate it and make sure that the remote functions work. After that, set it to update something like every 30 minutes. Batteries should last several months, maybe almost a year at this setting. This is what will result from having it not being connected constantly: When you tell it to lock remotely, it will not lock until the next time it connects, so there would be a maximum 30 minute delay if you told it to lock immediately after the last time it connected. Could be no delay. Just depends how the times line up. For unlocking the door, the same would apply BUT if somebody presses a button on the lock's keypad, it will connect and unlock the door at that time. That way, if somebody is at your door, you send the unlock signal, they press a button and it unlocks, so they won't have to wait up to 30 minutes for it to happen. Technically, the same would apply to locking, but it doesn't really serve much purpose in that scenario.<br /><br />I am very happy with this lock. The inconsistent app performance is the only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars.<br />You should be aware that there are other &#34;connected&#34; lock brands (that are out or coming out soon) that are more likely to work with home automation schemes. Lockitron comes to mind.<br /><br />A few Pros and Cons with Lockitron:<br />Pros:<br />1) Don't need to remember a code. When your phone's Bluetooth comes in range, it unlocks the door for you.<br />2) You can send temporary acces to someone else's phone (by text, I think).<br />3) More likely to interface with upcomming home automation gadgets.<br />4) a. Don't have to change your existing deadbolt, Lockitron attaches to it.<br />b. You don't need to change your key.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Looks cheap. Like one of those &#34;remotes&#34; that used to turn a TV's channel changer dial, back in the 70's.<br />2) Without a phone with he most current Bluetooh standard, neither you or your guest can unlock the door from outside.<br />3) IT MAY UNLOCK THE DOOR FOR STRANGERS!<br />The lock doesn't know if you are on the inside of the door or the outside of the door.<br />Picture this... You have your door locked and someone knocks at the door. You go to the door to see who it is.<br />Lockitron thinks you are on the outside trying to get in, so it unlocks the door before you can see who is there.<br />A solution to this would be to NOT keep

"After using surge protection for audio, video and computer equipment for more than 30 years I can definitely say not all of these products are created equally.<br /><br />While surge protectors will often boast of great protection, more often than not they are more multi outlet plugs rather than actual protection.<br /><br />I have thoroughly tested this surge protector and it has passed all of my testing.  While only rated for 700 joules, this is typically adequate especially when your home has proper grounding.  Often similar devices pass my tests initially yet fail after the 1 or 3 month mark - that has not been the case with this item.<br /><br />The way this is designed allowed me to utilize this in my bathroom to have all of my toiletry accessories charging at once yet have everything compact and tucked away.  It’s nice that this doubles as a nightlight that has adjustable levels of light and automatically turns on and off.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different was if on the sides the outlets were more widely spaced to allow for larger power blocks - with that being said having 6 outlets should allow most users to have more than enough.<br /><br />The 3 USB ports are definitely a nice addition as this helps avoid having to use plugs for USB powered devices.

"Update: Shortly after my review, an Anker rep got a hold of me through Amazon and offered to make things right with my bad cable. They offered to send me a replacement Powerline+, which is the updated version of these. I just received the cable and it looks much more robust. The housings are larger which I hope will alleviate my prior issue. Again, the other cables are working very well. I only had issues with the one. I have purchased Anker products in the past and have not been disappointed. This disappointment was rectified. Changed from 2 stars to 4 (not 5 because others can still have the same issue I did).<br /><br />Original: purchased 4 of these. The cable is high quality enough, but the mini connector on one of them is already bending at the housing and the contact is becoming intermittent. Had this for about 3 weeks now.

"I'm not an audiophile, but I've tried out a good number of different earbud brands lately, all across the quality spectrum. I'm grading on a curve here.<br /><br />Packaging is sufficient. A few tip sizes, quick start, instructions, and whatever is in that other manual of junk I always throw away. The earbud case is lozenge shaped and pocketable enough. No external lights, which is nice if you're charging it next to your bed, but not so much if you want to know their charge status.<br /><br />They are supposed to immediately start trying to bluetooth pair with something when first opened, and appeared to be trying to do so. My Surface was unable to locate them. I even tried with a second Surface. I plugged in the case and left it to charge for 15 minutes, and then they paired fine. Overall on unboxing and setup, I'd say they're adequate, but far from exceptional.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves are aggressively visible. I assume they're trying to ride the I-Pod branding success, but I'm not really feeling it. Despite looking huge, they don't feel huge. They are lightweight and comfortable. They don't feel like they are going to fall out, despite not feeling like they're crammed in the ear. Fit is unusual in that you can turn the earbud like a screw to make it tighter or looser. Sound is good. I'm giving them very low marks for appearance, and very good for fit and sound.<br /><br />These use swipe style controls, which I despise. I much prefer a physical button that I can just feel that I've clicked. The controls do work as advertised, but there's enough delay that it often takes me a while of swiping my ear and waiting until it gets the message. Mostly irritating when someone tries to talk to me and I can't get it to pause for several seconds.<br /><br />Range is average.<br /><br />Overall, Id' say there's a bit of a brand name premium on the price compared to some other products, and I'm saying that as someone who has used Surface products as my primary computers for many years now, but they're not bad. I've definitely tried more expensive earbuds that weren't as good, but of what I've tried, I'm happiest so far with the Jabra Elite series of earbuds.",4.0,im not an audiophile but ive tried out a good number of different earbud brands lately all across the quality spectrum im grading on a curve herebr br packaging is sufficient a few tip sizes quick start instructions and whatever is in that other manual of junk i always throw away the earbud case is lozenge shaped and pocketable enough no external lights which is nice if youre charging it next to your bed but not so much if you want to know their charge statusbr br they are supposed to immediately start trying to bluetooth pair with something when first opened and appeared to be trying to do so my surface was unable to locate them i even tried with a second surface i plugged in the case and left it to charge for minutes and then they paired fine overall on unboxing and setup id say theyre adequate but far from exceptionalbr br the earbuds themselves are aggressively visible i assume theyre trying to ride the ipod branding success but im not really feeling it despite looking huge they dont feel huge they are lightweight and comfortable they dont feel like they are going to fall out despite not feeling like theyre crammed in the ear fit is unusual in that you can turn the earbud like a screw to make it tighter or looser sound is good im giving them very low marks for appearance and very good for fit and soundbr br these use swipe style controls which i despise i much prefer a physical button that i can just feel that ive clicked the controls do work as advertised but theres enough delay that it often takes me a while of swiping my ear and waiting until it gets the message mostly irritating when someone tries to talk to me and i cant get it to pause for several secondsbr br range is averagebr br overall id say theres a bit of a brand name premium on the price compared to some other products and im saying that as someone who has used surface products as my primary computers for many years now but theyre not bad ive definitely tried more expensive earbuds that werent as good but of what ive tried im happiest so far with the jabra elite series of earbuds,2083
"Overall, this is a very nice golf GPS for the price. I was a little worried about it being too complicated to use, but the manual explains all the features in reasonably good detail. I found it helpful to keep the manual with me the first couple of times I used it on the course to refer to, but after a few outings I felt comfortable using it.<br /><br />I had an initial problem with the battery life in that it quit on me after about an hour of use. After leaving it in the charging cradle overnight, the next time it maintained its charge for a full afternoon's use. I've used it (and recharged it) several times since then and have had no problems, so it seems the first time was just a momentary glitch (or perhaps I didn't seat the charging cable firmly enough).<br /><br />I very much like that it does not require a subscription to use, nor does it need to be tethered to a PC for the initial setup. It has a pretty extensive database of courses (Izzo says on their website that they cover 90% of the courses in the US). You can use their website to look up a course to see if it is included in the database.<br /><br />Sat acquisition times is quick - took only a few minutes to get a lock and find my course the first time I used it. Acquisition time was even faster on subsequent uses. It uses a SiRF Star III receiver.<br /><br />The display is clear even in sunlight, but it is a bit small for me. I don't usually have my reading glasses with me when I'm outdoors, so seeing the distance numbers took quite a bit of squinting. Granted, if you don't have aging eyes you won't find that to be a problem, but it would have been nice to have a larger display.<br /><br />I also didn't find it all that comfortable to wear. It is lightweight and not too thick, but the strap was not very comfortable. Plus the greenish/yellow accent color (found on the inside of the strap and the sides of the unit) didn't appeal to me much - rather garish looking to my eye.<br /><br />The warranty is only 90 days, which I think is too short given the price -- a year would be more appropriate.<br /><br />But those are minor quibbles. Overall, the functionality is great - quick to acquire sats, accurate distances and straightforward to use. Considering the price of other brands, such as Garmin, this is a great value. Definitely should be on the short list if you're shopping for a golf GPS.<br /><br />[As an aside, it's a real bear to the product out of the clamshell packaging. I didn't' factor that into the rating, but set aside some time to wrestle it out of the plastic jail it comes in should you buy one.]",4.0,overall this is a very nice golf gps for the price i was a little worried about it being too complicated to use but the manual explains all the features in reasonably good detail i found it helpful to keep the manual with me the first couple of times i used it on the course to refer to but after a few outings i felt comfortable using itbr br i had an initial problem with the battery life in that it quit on me after about an hour of use after leaving it in the charging cradle overnight the next time it maintained its charge for a full afternoons use ive used it and recharged it several times since then and have had no problems so it seems the first time was just a momentary glitch or perhaps i didnt seat the charging cable firmly enoughbr br i very much like that it does not require a subscription to use nor does it need to be tethered to a pc for the initial setup it has a pretty extensive database of courses izzo says on their website that they cover of the courses in the us you can use their website to look up a course to see if it is included in the databasebr br sat acquisition times is quick took only a few minutes to get a lock and find my course the first time i used it acquisition time was even faster on subsequent uses it uses a sirf star iii receiverbr br the display is clear even in sunlight but it is a bit small for me i dont usually have my reading glasses with me when im outdoors so seeing the distance numbers took quite a bit of squinting granted if you dont have aging eyes you wont find that to be a problem but it would have been nice to have a larger displaybr br i also didnt find it all that comfortable to wear it is lightweight and not too thick but the strap was not very comfortable plus the greenishyellow accent color found on the inside of the strap and the sides of the unit didnt appeal to me much rather garish looking to my eyebr br the warranty is only days which i think is too short given the price a year would be more appropriatebr br but those are minor quibbles overall the functionality is great quick to acquire sats accurate distances and straightforward to use considering the price of other brands such as garmin this is a great value definitely should be on the short list if youre shopping for a golf gpsbr br as an aside its a real bear to the product out of the clamshell packaging i didnt factor that into the rating but set aside some time to wrestle it out of the plastic jail it comes in should you buy one,2482

"Packaging was a bit mediocre. A cardboard card with the strap through it in a dingy plastic bag. Strap appears to be new/unused and in good condition.<br /><br />This fits my Kodak Z990 digital camera perfectly. A much more comfortable carrying solution than the thin strap Kodak included with the camera.<br /><br />I'm a heavyset guy and with the strap nowhere near as long as it could be adjusted to I have the camera hanging just at arm's length. I can comfortably hold the camera by my side while I walk around.<br /><br />Adjusting the fit isn't easy which is good. This means your strap isn't going to slip (my Kodak loosened up all the time). It make take a little effort and time but it secures the camera well.<br /><br />The padded section of the neck strap could be a little longer. The swivel hinges and spring clips which hold the mounting strap to the padded neck band catch me right in the collarbone. The spring loaded clips feel sturdy and don't seem like they can accidentally be released. The padding itself is very comfortable on my neck. I feel like I could carry my camera for hours without and discomfort.<br /><br />My only complaint, as minor as it may be, is the product labels stitched to the padded section of the strap system. The padding is soft and the labels well stitched in place. They couldn't be ripped out so I had to spend a few minutes carefully trimming them (there are several different tags) away with a pair of scissors.<br /><br />This is a nice update to the basic straps many manufacturers send out with their products.

"So this is a very large screen set up for a big room or outdoor use. That being said, there's also a reason they included stakes and rope in the kit--this thing is basically a sail and will fly away if outside and not properly secured.<br /><br />The good:<br />- The screen is very large and the ""rig"" does a good job of stretching the screen taut; no wrinkles!<br />- Lightweight kit overall<br />- Can be wall or tripod mounted<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />- Personally, getting this kit, laying it all out and putting it together... I found it really annoying. There were moments when I felt like that inept person trying to work a gadget on an infomercial. You know what I'm talking about. But seriously, having six different poles fitting into these holes, then stretching the screen to get all the grommets looped was... annoying. Nothing was described inaccurately in the description, and looking at it online, you think--hey, that doesn't look so bad. And it's not like it was HARD... but the whole process was obnoxious and not something I want to put up, take down, put up, take down, etc.<br />- No carrying bag or case is included with the kit, so all these pieces are just free floating through your life waiting to get lost if you only use this thing periodically. Find a nice box or bag to keep everything in, because there isn't one provided (again, it doesn't say there is... but something like this REALLY needs it even a cheap nylon number. Please.)<br />- Suuuper top-heavy and will easily fall or blow over if not indoors or properly secured.<br />- Screen is kind of see-through. Which would be fine if you were rear-projecting. But you can't do that, because of the rods... so... Works best in lower light conditions.<br /><br />Good to know:<br />- The kit includes command strips to affix the center rod-hub to the wall. The size of this thing is really not conducive to that method of hanging, honestly. If you use command strips and posters fall down, this will too.

"This Nexigo camera is overall an outstanding camera. The picture quality is among the best out of any camera I've used. It's crisp and clear and doesn't distort when zooming or panning. The menu is good and has some great features, like the ability to turn on a black and white filter as part of the built-in camera software. You can even preset zoom settings to return to at a touch of a button. I like using the remote better than an AI camera (which I've also used). While AI PTZ can be nice, sometimes you end up fighting it, when the camera moves or zooms when you don't actually want it to. I like having a higher level of control with this remote.<br /><br />That being said, I also use ManyCam to do streaming when I teach. I've found the camera works well with some elements of the streaming software, but not with others.<br /><br />In ManyCam, using features like backgrounds and objects seem to disable the menu, zoom, pan and focus functions of the camera. They just don't work anymore--so you have to make sure you've got the camera set where you want it before you turn those things on.

I like that it has double the internal memory compared to a 16 gig. Fast interface and overall usage. Their is a known user interface glitch that has come to my attention and I had to return my first until for a replacement. Thanks to  Amazon and Erica in the TX call center for helping me with that. Explained how my tablet was factory reset twice during the 5 week period that I owned it. Occasionally and then more frequently like multiple times it would show that ugly dreaded ui system has failed and the device stops responding. Come to find out after some research that it's common after a system update such as android and other Google apps.  There are some helpful videos on YouTube that show step by step how to fix the issue.,4.0,i like that it has double the internal memory compared to a gig fast interface and overall usage their is a known user interface glitch that has come to my attention and i had to return my first until for a replacement thanks to amazon and erica in the tx call center for helping me with that explained how my tablet was factory reset twice during the week period that i owned it occasionally and then more frequently like multiple times it would show that ugly dreaded ui system has failed and the device stops responding come to find out after some research that its common after a system update such as android and other google apps there are some helpful videos on youtube that show step by step how to fix the issue,720
If everyone would start using these there would be a lot less cyber crime. Unfortunately at this time it's usage is still limited for a lot of things.  I wanted it to be able to login to Windows and still be a fully functional MFA device and this isn't possible at this time.  They are however working on it supposedly.  I tested the app that they are using to login to Windows and it's no where near working right and still allowing you to use the Yubi Key as MFA.  It has two programmable slots that are a little difficult to figure out which one you are working with.  I am still going to talk more with Yubico about these issues and see if I am missing something.  I downloaded the manager software and the personalization software.  They are not very user friendly but that isn't my issue.  These keys work great right out of the box for normal MFA/2FA purposes.  I just want to be able to use it for more then that personally.  I wish more sites would implement FIDO2 MFA or at least some form of MFA because right now there are not enough out there.,4.0,if everyone would start using these there would be a lot less cyber crime unfortunately at this time its usage is still limited for a lot of things i wanted it to be able to login to windows and still be a fully functional mfa device and this isnt possible at this time they are however working on it supposedly i tested the app that they are using to login to windows and its no where near working right and still allowing you to use the yubi key as mfa it has two programmable slots that are a little difficult to figure out which one you are working with i am still going to talk more with yubico about these issues and see if i am missing something i downloaded the manager software and the personalization software they are not very user friendly but that isnt my issue these keys work great right out of the box for normal mfafa purposes i just want to be able to use it for more then that personally i wish more sites would implement fido mfa or at least some form of mfa because right now there are not enough out there,1027

"Picked up one of these during a recent Gold Box deal sale. I purchased this to replace a set of rabbit ear antenna that I've been using on the television in my bedroom. Living about 25 miles outside town there were some stations I was having problems with (since the switch over to digital). I was under the impression that an antenna was an antenna and these so-call 'digital' or 'HDTV' antennas were just the same-old stuff with a new buzz word attached. Then I happened to watch a documentary on fractals and one of the practical applications they showed for those were new designs in antenna technology. So when I saw these ultra thin antennas on sale I figured I would give one a try. I bought one of the non-amplified ones to start (the rabbit ears set I was using was amplified). I have to say that this new antenna does work somewhat better than what I was using. Still have some weak channels, but there is about a 25% increase in overall signal strength - which is enough to now be able to watch those weaker stations.<br /><br />I like that you get a set of push-pins to mount the antenna yo the wall, I was planing on using something like that and was glad I didn't need to find some. I also like that there is a choice of colors (black or white). I just wish the cable was a more neutral color.

"I have had this camera about a week and absolutely love most things about it. Super fast focusing, great low light performance, awesome pictures, superb macros, stunning lcd display, great body, and the list goes on. You've seen it all in the other reviews. It's a wonderful camera that I can carry with me for strolls and spur-of-the-moment shots. I would love to have been able to use this for street photography, but because Canon saw fit to do away with the articulated tilt screen, this is not so very practicable now. It's so much easier to get great candid shots of people when you're not so obviously balancing a camera out in front of you at chin level or higher, trying to compose your shot. With a tilt screen or articulated screen you just casually hang your head to look down at the screen, and a quiet, incognito, stealth shot, with the camera hanging low in front at chest level, is so much easier to carry off discreetly and without bringing attention to yourself. With a fixed screen - not. Huge disappointment in that department. What was Canon thinking? Did someone at the design meeting say: ""Gentlemen, perhaps we should step back a pace. This camera is so awesome that if we included the tilt screen, like we did for its last 3 predecessors, we'd leave the competition choking in our wake. That would not be fair. Gotta keep the competitors healthy and happy. Let's ditch the tilt screen."" How logical was that???<br /><br />So, now I'm faced with trying to decide between this camera and its close competitor the very cool, but somewhat slower-to-focus Nikon P7700. Also, the Nikon's flash is virtually unusable on macro photos because it casts the lens' shadow over your subject. Even though the Nikon also has a 20x zoom lens in its favor and many other awesome features, that slower focus is kind of off-putting... After all, usually you want to actually capture ""that"" moment, not the one that comes 2.5 seconds later. Also, I love macro photography and really resent that shadow. Who designed that flash anyway???<br /><br />Hence, my dilemma. What to do...?  What to do...?",4.0,i have had this camera about a week and absolutely love most things about it super fast focusing great low light performance awesome pictures superb macros stunning lcd display great body and the list goes on youve seen it all in the other reviews its a wonderful camera that i can carry with me for strolls and spurofthemoment shots i would love to have been able to use this for street photography but because canon saw fit to do away with the articulated tilt screen this is not so very practicable now its so much easier to get great candid shots of people when youre not so obviously balancing a camera out in front of you at chin level or higher trying to compose your shot with a tilt screen or articulated screen you just casually hang your head to look down at the screen and a quiet incognito stealth shot with the camera hanging low in front at chest level is so much easier to carry off discreetly and without bringing attention to yourself with a fixed screen not huge disappointment in that department what was canon thinking did someone at the design meeting say gentlemen perhaps we should step back a pace this camera is so awesome that if we included the tilt screen like we did for its last predecessors wed leave the competition choking in our wake that would not be fair gotta keep the competitors healthy and happy lets ditch the tilt screen how logical was thatbr br so now im faced with trying to decide between this camera and its close competitor the very cool but somewhat slowertofocus nikon p also the nikons flash is virtually unusable on macro photos because it casts the lens shadow over your subject even though the nikon also has a x zoom lens in its favor and many other awesome features that slower focus is kind of offputting after all usually you want to actually capture that moment not the one that comes seconds later also i love macro photography and really resent that shadow who designed that flash anywaybr br hence my dilemma what to do what to do,1993

"Many cars on the market come with a rear-view camera that allows for seeing where the vehicle is moving when in reverse. Often the view appears on a dashboard screen. This is handy when parking and maneuvering while the vehicle is backing up. For vehicles that do not have a rear-view camera the alternative is to add on a kit that provides the same functionality. This is my first experience with such a kit and so far I am pleased with it. It does require doing a little work on the vehicle to set it up but the effort is worth it.<br /><br />The package contains everything needed to set up this camera system. In addition to the camera and the screen, the kit includes the mounting screws for the actual camera as well as all of the wiring to connect everything together and to the power (reverse lights). There is also a mini-remote for interacting with the video screen though this is slightly inconvenient.<br /><br />I spent a good deal of time reading and rereading the directions and concluded that the instructions could have been better. There are three pieces of documentation in the box; one shows a generalized set of four different configurations for connecting everything together (the fourth diagram on this sheet matches the configuration you want), one is a photocopied image of a wired system and the third is a “User’s Manual” which is one half-sheet of paper with a brief summarization of the product. There really needs to be a better documentation set than this.<br /><br />If you are not skilled in working with electrical systems, either plan on this taking a good while or have someone you trust install the system. It’s not especially hard to set one of these up, but it does take some patience and a little bit of knowledge of the layout of the car’s wiring. I have worked on car electrical systems in the distant past so I had a vague familiarity, but it still took me a while to have everything set up and working.<br /><br />Once wired the system is fairly straightforward to use. If it is wired up properly (meaning everything is connected to power on both ends and the two main components can see one another) it works nicely. The image when the camera is feeding to the monitor is bright and reasonably clear; the brightness can be adjusted as needed which helps when using this system at night. Another reviewer commented that he used a different camera connected to this system - while I am personally satisfied with the image quality, it’s reassuring to know that you can use another video camera if desired or necessary.<br /><br />The addition of the remote will appeal to some, but for me it’s a component that can easily be lost. The menu system on the monitor provides the same functionality as the remote and this is good enough for me.<br /><br />This is my first experience with rear-view video systems and though it gave me a little trouble setting up it was from lack of good documentation and inexperience, not from being a bad product. Once installed this is a nice and easy-to-use video system. Time will tell how long it works.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I recently acquired a pair of Able Planet Sound Clarity (SC hereafter) headphones, just 6 days after purchasing a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 15 Noise Canceling headphones (QC15 hereafter). I got a very good deal on the Able Planet phones, which is the main reason I bought them. With both sets in hand, I have been able to do a side-by-side comparison between them. Bose is generally regarded as the Gold Standard when it comes to active noise canceling phones so this review is spun in that regard. I have not had a chance to try the Sennheiser offerings, so I cannot comment on those.<br /><br />In summary, the Able Planet phones compare reasonably well against the Bose phones, but there are some trade-offs between the two. Which set to buy depends on the personal preferences and intended uses.<br /><br />First off, the phones look very similar to one another. The general design is the same, with an over-the-ear design, soft pads and an on-off switch for noise cancellation. There are some very distinct differences, though, that are not obvious at a glance. First, the detachable cord plugs in somewhat differently, the SC having a jack that this flush with the phone and the QC15 having a jack that is inset within the base of the phone, with a molded plug. The battery compartment is also accessed differently, the SC having a sliding cover exposing 2 AAA batteries and the QC15 having a flip-up cover for a single AAA battery.<br /><br />Another visible difference is in the cord that is included with the SC phones - it has a volume control thumb wheel. The QC15 phones have simply on/off. I like being able to adjust the volume without fiddling with the source such as a computer.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, Bose has an upper hand on Able Planet. While both have an over-the-ear design which covers the ear, the SC cup is a hair smaller and as such it cannot cover the whole ear as easily as the QC15. That said, the SC phones are still comfortable and the difference is minor.<br /><br />The noise canceling aspect of the SC phones is very good but it does not compare to the QC15 headset. Standing next to a running air handler that is roughly the size of a minivan, the SC is able to wipe out a good portion of the noise to make the level comfortable. The QC15 wiped out the sound of the air handler completely, to the point that it was difficult to tell if it was even turned on.<br /><br />I was interested in the Linx Audio aspect of the SC phones and at first I was very disappointed. The high range is somewhat dampened, ""S"" sometimes sounding like ""PH"". However, the mid and low ranges are solid and are very rich, whereas Bose sounds good but has remarkably less depth. The QC15 phones are primarily noise canceling phones, and sound quality is secondary to that. The SC headset achieves a better balance of sound to noise canceling.<br /><br />Once very distinct advantage that the SC headset has is that the phones will work without power, though noise canceling does not work in that case. The QC15 requires a working battery and must be turned on to work at all.<br /><br />Right out of the box, my SC phones were defective. I contacted Able Planet, hoping I could get some advice on how to adjust them, but instead I got an RMA number. Less than 2 weeks later I had a new, working pair in my hands that work much better than the initial pair. Customer service at Able Planet is very responsive, professional and courteous. With the LIFETIME warranty on their headphones, Bose cannot answer with their 2-year warranty.<br /><br />Which pair to buy is a matter of preference and intended use. If the intended primary use is noise cancellation and comfort, Bose is the right choice. For listening to music with the ability to engage noise canceling when needed, Able Planet is a better choice. Considering the 2-year Bose warranty against an Able Planet lifetime warranty, though, is hard to ignore.<br /><br />As I use my phones for listening to music more than anything else, I use the Able Planet headset as my primary headset and I keep my Bose headset as a backup.",4.0,i recently acquired a pair of able planet sound clarity sc hereafter headphones just days after purchasing a pair of bose quiet comfort noise canceling headphones qc hereafter i got a very good deal on the able planet phones which is the main reason i bought them with both sets in hand i have been able to do a sidebyside comparison between them bose is generally regarded as the gold standard when it comes to active noise canceling phones so this review is spun in that regard i have not had a chance to try the sennheiser offerings so i cannot comment on thosebr br in summary the able planet phones compare reasonably well against the bose phones but there are some tradeoffs between the two which set to buy depends on the personal preferences and intended usesbr br first off the phones look very similar to one another the general design is the same with an overtheear design soft pads and an onoff switch for noise cancellation there are some very distinct differences though that are not obvious at a glance first the detachable cord plugs in somewhat differently the sc having a jack that this flush with the phone and the qc having a jack that is inset within the base of the phone with a molded plug the battery compartment is also accessed differently the sc having a sliding cover exposing aaa batteries and the qc having a flipup cover for a single aaa batterybr br another visible difference is in the cord that is included with the sc phones it has a volume control thumb wheel the qc phones have simply onoff i like being able to adjust the volume without fiddling with the source such as a computerbr br comfortwise bose has an upper hand on able planet while both have an overtheear design which covers the ear the sc cup is a hair smaller and as such it cannot cover the whole ear as easily as the qc that said the sc phones are still comfortable and the difference is minorbr br the noise canceling aspect of the sc phones is very good but it does not compare to the qc headset standing next to a running air handler that is roughly the size of a minivan the sc is able to wipe out a good portion of the noise to make the level comfortable the qc wiped out the sound of the air handler completely to the point that it was difficult to tell if it was even turned onbr br i was interested in the linx audio aspect of the sc phones and at first i was very disappointed the high range is somewhat dampened s sometimes sounding like ph however the mid and low ranges are solid and are very rich whereas bose sounds good but has remarkably less depth the qc phones are primarily noise canceling phones and sound quality is secondary to that the sc headset achieves a better balance of sound to noise cancelingbr br once very distinct advantage that the sc headset has is that the phones will work without power though noise canceling does not work in that case the qc requires a working battery and must be turned on to work at allbr br right out of the box my sc phones were defective i contacted able planet hoping i could get some advice on how to adjust them but instead i got an rma number less than weeks later i had a new working pair in my hands that work much better than the initial pair customer service at able planet is very responsive professional and courteous with the lifetime warranty on their headphones bose cannot answer with their year warrantybr br which pair to buy is a matter of preference and intended use if the intended primary use is noise cancellation and comfort bose is the right choice for listening to music with the ability to engage noise canceling when needed able planet is a better choice considering the year bose warranty against an able planet lifetime warranty though is hard to ignorebr br as i use my phones for listening to music more than anything else i use the able planet headset as my primary headset and i keep my bose headset as a backup,3908

It works fine. A different format that I will have to get used to. I thought I ordered a Kindle that was on sale with a fifty dollar discount if I signed up for an Amazon credit card. it looks like you charged my old credit card full price and the didn't give me a $50 credit. So instead of $29.95 plus shipping I think I spent over $90.

"I'm normally an ear bud user since I've never been able to find an over the ear headset that was comfortable to wear for more than 10 minutes or so at a time. Well, I found one - these are undoubtable the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. Just a dream to wear even for extended periods of time. Light, cushy, just right. And they look so elegant - a nice change from the sparse industrial look that electronics often have.<br /><br />Construction quality seems very good, especially the cord (a common point of failure for me with any type of earphones). It comes with the regular and mini size plugs.<br /><br />The sound quality is absolutly top-notch. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't throw out the phrases and jargon I typically read in audio discussion boards and magazines (well, I can throw them out, but not with any semblance of knowing what I'm taking about). So suffice it to say that I can't imagine anyone not being very pleased with the quality of sound using these and a MP3 player or an iPad (the two devices I've used with them so far). I've been absolutely amazed at how great these sound.<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of sound isolation. Outside sounds can easily be heard. Sometimes that's good, but most of the time I prefer to be isolated from whatever else is playing in the house. I'm finding I reach for these more often when I'm in a quiet environment, and use ear buds when there's a lot of noise about (with me defining noise as any type of music I don't care for).<br /><br />With the caveat of the lack of sound blocking, these should absolutely be on your short list if you're looking for a comfortable, great sounding pair of earphones.",4.0,im normally an ear bud user since ive never been able to find an over the ear headset that was comfortable to wear for more than minutes or so at a time well i found one these are undoubtable the most comfortable headphones ive ever used just a dream to wear even for extended periods of time light cushy just right and they look so elegant a nice change from the sparse industrial look that electronics often havebr br construction quality seems very good especially the cord a common point of failure for me with any type of earphones it comes with the regular and mini size plugsbr br the sound quality is absolutly topnotch im not an audiophile so i cant throw out the phrases and jargon i typically read in audio discussion boards and magazines well i can throw them out but not with any semblance of knowing what im taking about so suffice it to say that i cant imagine anyone not being very pleased with the quality of sound using these and a mp player or an ipad the two devices ive used with them so far ive been absolutely amazed at how great these soundbr br my only complaint is the lack of sound isolation outside sounds can easily be heard sometimes thats good but most of the time i prefer to be isolated from whatever else is playing in the house im finding i reach for these more often when im in a quiet environment and use ear buds when theres a lot of noise about with me defining noise as any type of music i dont care forbr br with the caveat of the lack of sound blocking these should absolutely be on your short list if youre looking for a comfortable great sounding pair of earphones,1608

"I am an audiophile but I always take into account the nature of the product that I am looking at or listening to. One cannot possibly expect a $99 portable bluetooth speaker to have legitimate audiophile sound. In this case, we're talking about the Creative Sound Blaster Roar. And that assertion is not in any way a knock on this product. I bought one a few days ago and I like it and am quite happy with the purchase for a variety of reasons. The main reason I like it is because the sound it produces is GOOD. That sound is not great nor is it bad. Perhaps the worst credible thing you might say about the sound is simply that it is FINE. When I consider the size of the unit (and the size of the very small speakers it contains) and the cost, I judge the sound to be GOOD. You are not going to get Martin Logan or Definitive Technology sound out of the Roar, plain and simple. Nor will you get super sound out of any of the other competitive products such as the Bose or JBL, etc. I think they all produce generally good sound for the money. The best and smartest thing a buyer can do is perhaps go to<br />Best Buy or any of the other retailers who carry such units and give them all a listen and look at the features they offer and then buy the one that meets your needs in terms of both sound quality and features. Having said that, for me the Roar has more features than any of the<br />competing units.  That is simply fact and not opinion. Most of the products that are in this category seem to be made well but in my opinion, the Roar seems to be made just a little sturdier. I haven't tested that notion by dropping my Roar  on the floor but in my hands it simply feels<br /> more robust. Back to the sound question.....since I seriously doubt that many users of portable bluetooth speakers plan on doing serious<br />listening that entails sitting in a quite room and doing nothing but listening intently to these little portable speakers, consider how they will actually be used.  Most people are playing them as background music while they are doing other things such as sitting on the beach or<br />cooking on the grill or in the kitchen, etc. Critical listening ain't happening here. So let's not talk about sound imaging or speaker spatiality etc. That said, for me, I don't like speakers that have a bass response that overwhelms everything else.  I want a more natural sound, One that is<br /><br /> more balanced to my ear. Because of that, I will gravitate towards something like the Roar. If you are one who wants more bass, then you will assuredly better like the sound of any Bose product as they have made a fortune producing bass heavy products for the last 50 years. Again, for me, the features are a big deal and the Roar excels inn that regard.  I won't waste your time talking about them as you can look such things up just as easily.  And price is a big deal to me.  The Roar 1 can be had for $99 now.... so I bought one. The Bose is $299 the last time I checked,...three times the cost of the Roar. So simply put, I loved the price of the Roar, the feature list is unmatched, it feels like military grade construction and lastly, I thought the sound was GOOD. That's why I bought it.",4.0,i am an audiophile but i always take into account the nature of the product that i am looking at or listening to one cannot possibly expect a portable bluetooth speaker to have legitimate audiophile sound in this case were talking about the creative sound blaster roar and that assertion is not in any way a knock on this product i bought one a few days ago and i like it and am quite happy with the purchase for a variety of reasons the main reason i like it is because the sound it produces is good that sound is not great nor is it bad perhaps the worst credible thing you might say about the sound is simply that it is fine when i consider the size of the unit and the size of the very small speakers it contains and the cost i judge the sound to be good you are not going to get martin logan or definitive technology sound out of the roar plain and simple nor will you get super sound out of any of the other competitive products such as the bose or jbl etc i think they all produce generally good sound for the money the best and smartest thing a buyer can do is perhaps go tobr best buy or any of the other retailers who carry such units and give them all a listen and look at the features they offer and then buy the one that meets your needs in terms of both sound quality and features having said that for me the roar has more features than any of thebr competing units that is simply fact and not opinion most of the products that are in this category seem to be made well but in my opinion the roar seems to be made just a little sturdier i havent tested that notion by dropping my roar on the floor but in my hands it simply feelsbr more robust back to the sound questionsince i seriously doubt that many users of portable bluetooth speakers plan on doing seriousbr listening that entails sitting in a quite room and doing nothing but listening intently to these little portable speakers consider how they will actually be used most people are playing them as background music while they are doing other things such as sitting on the beach orbr cooking on the grill or in the kitchen etc critical listening aint happening here so lets not talk about sound imaging or speaker spatiality etc that said for me i dont like speakers that have a bass response that overwhelms everything else i want a more natural sound one that isbr br more balanced to my ear because of that i will gravitate towards something like the roar if you are one who wants more bass then you will assuredly better like the sound of any bose product as they have made a fortune producing bass heavy products for the last years again for me the features are a big deal and the roar excels inn that regard i wont waste your time talking about them as you can look such things up just as easily and price is a big deal to me the roar can be had for now so i bought one the bose is the last time i checkedthree times the cost of the roar so simply put i loved the price of the roar the feature list is unmatched it feels like military grade construction and lastly i thought the sound was good thats why i bought it,3095

"Since there have only been a couple of reviews written about this product, I figured that a bit more information would be helpful for anyone looking to purchase this 20' telescoping mast from Channel Master.<br /><br />First of all, I have to take issue with the reviewer who complained that this mast wasn't sturdy or thick enough for his installation, which happened to include a wind turbine. This is NOT A TOWER. IT IS AN ANTENNA MAST!!! It's only intended use is for mounting external antennas. Period. Specifically, they are manufactured to support Channel Master's wide line of outdoor TV antenna products. It should work fine for most other brands of TV antennas as well and can probably support other relatively lightweight items (i.e. home weather stations, small ham radio or CB antennas). It is NOT intended to be used for heavy loads, such as wind turbines. For the price they are charging, what do you expect though? A ""real"" telescoping tower for applications like wind power will cost you thousands of dollars. Free standing towers made of high-strength tubular steel is what's required for heavy loads, and they must be anchored in a concrete base. Anything less than that and you are putting their entire structure, as well as whatever building you mount it to, in jeopardy. Not to mention the fact that you are likely in serious violation of local zoning ordinances. This item is for TV antennas, and does an admirable job of it.<br /><br />I recently installed one of these units at a commercial location that had absolutely no reliable reception on any channels. A small gust of wind would knock out reception completely, and the high-gain Yagi TV antenna that had been installed was quite expensive and on a 10' mast above the structure. It even had a preamp and rotor for fine tuning. For the new installation, I used the Channel Master CM 1820 mast in combination with a Winegard AP8275 Chromstar 2000 Preamplifier and a Winegard HD8200U Platinum HD VHF/UHF Antenna. I had gone with some other brands in the past that had let me down, so I wanted to see if using the Winegard equipment made any kind of difference.<br /><br />Despite the new and old antennas only being about 20' away from each other, the Channel Master/Winegard installation was like going from night to day for pulling in TV signals. Without using a rotor or doing any type of fine tuning (I had a good idea of where the antenna should be pointed, but that's it) the customer's reception has been rock solid. It pulls in both HDTV and low power NTSC translator signals on both UHF and VHF-HI. I have the tower itself extended about 15' with a total of four wall mount brackets bracing it against a wall for stability. I've never needed to use the guy wires. The HD8200U is one of the largest VHF/UHF TV antennas available in North America. So, if it can support this model, it can probably support just about any other TV antenna you can attach to it. Wind speeds at the location gust up to about 35 mph, which has never had a noticeable effect on the signal.<br /><br />About the only downside I can report on this particular product is the lack of adequate documentation and the way it is shipped. Basically, you get a giant 10' metal pipe in the mail/UPS with a shipping label on it and supporting hardware taped to one end. What little documentation there is, is rolled up inside the mast itself. One other thing that bugs me about manufacturers these days is the lack of part numbers (or even names, sometimes) included in the documentation. If you need to order a spare part, you can't ask for a specific part # and no specs are given so that you can look for parts locally. Call it a pet peeve, but it will cost the manufacturer one star in this case.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the customer was extremely satisfied with the installation and quality of the signal(s). It is actually being used for a mission-critical commercial application that requires 24/7/365 reception of digital signals. The mast, paired with the right antenna, amplifier, RG-6, weatherproofing and a professional (or at least professional-like) installation should assure you the best results possible under the circumstances. Even in an area where little to no reception should be possible, the mast helped give us the edge we needed to get the job done right for the customer the first time. HDTV reception is far superior to what I have seen on the local cable TV system for the same channels. For what this mast costs compared to the slightly cheaper ones you will find at local hardware stores, I'd say it's a pretty hard deal to beat.<br /><br />One last detail: Please note that this mast does NOT come with all of the guy wire hardware you will need if you intend to secure it via that method. The mast itself is ""guy wire ready"", but no actual guy wire or anchoring (to the structure) hardware is included. Fortunately, this hardware is pretty universally available. The cost is not trivial for heavy gauge installations, but the parts should be readily available online or locally at most hardware stores.",4.0,since there have only been a couple of reviews written about this product i figured that a bit more information would be helpful for anyone looking to purchase this telescoping mast from channel masterbr br first of all i have to take issue with the reviewer who complained that this mast wasnt sturdy or thick enough for his installation which happened to include a wind turbine this is not a tower it is an antenna mast its only intended use is for mounting external antennas period specifically they are manufactured to support channel masters wide line of outdoor tv antenna products it should work fine for most other brands of tv antennas as well and can probably support other relatively lightweight items ie home weather stations small ham radio or cb antennas it is not intended to be used for heavy loads such as wind turbines for the price they are charging what do you expect though a real telescoping tower for applications like wind power will cost you thousands of dollars free standing towers made of highstrength tubular steel is whats required for heavy loads and they must be anchored in a concrete base anything less than that and you are putting their entire structure as well as whatever building you mount it to in jeopardy not to mention the fact that you are likely in serious violation of local zoning ordinances this item is for tv antennas and does an admirable job of itbr br i recently installed one of these units at a commercial location that had absolutely no reliable reception on any channels a small gust of wind would knock out reception completely and the highgain yagi tv antenna that had been installed was quite expensive and on a mast above the structure it even had a preamp and rotor for fine tuning for the new installation i used the channel master cm mast in combination with a winegard ap chromstar preamplifier and a winegard hdu platinum hd vhfuhf antenna i had gone with some other brands in the past that had let me down so i wanted to see if using the winegard equipment made any kind of differencebr br despite the new and old antennas only being about away from each other the channel masterwinegard installation was like going from night to day for pulling in tv signals without using a rotor or doing any type of fine tuning i had a good idea of where the antenna should be pointed but thats it the customers reception has been rock solid it pulls in both hdtv and low power ntsc translator signals on both uhf and vhfhi i have the tower itself extended about with a total of four wall mount brackets bracing it against a wall for stability ive never needed to use the

"I have a Nuvi 360. It came with a suction cup windshield mount. It also came with a steel disk with double sticky adhesive on the back. I was supposed to mount this disk somewhere on my dashboard, then use the suction cup to attach the mount. I didn't want to use the suction mount directly onto the windshield because 1) it telegraphs the presence of an expensive GPS unit, 2) it's illegal in California to attach anything to the windshield and 3) I don't think the suction cup would last very long.<br /><br />Then there's the disk with the very permanent double sticky tape. The problem with almost all cars these days is there really isn't anywhere to attach the disk discreetly. Every square inch is taken with existing stuff. And who wants an ugly disk glued to the dash anyway? And what if I want to use the GPS in other vehicles? More disks?<br /><br />So I settled on this ""beanbag"" mount with the ball mount arm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, before the beanbag friction mount arrived, I was flexing the arm in the suction cup mount and noticed the suction cup's mounting bracket had already broken. I had never even attached it to anything! The mount is beautifully engineered and built...except for one area where the arm's hinge pin attaches to the suction cup's plastic hinge loops. The loops are too thin and fragile. The loops cracked and broke with hardly any hinging at all.<br /><br />So now I have a quite useless suction mount but a very functional ball arm. What to do?<br /><br />I drove the hinge pin out of the ball arm. Then I took two small 1"" x 1"" steel angle brackets and attached them to the ball arm with a 2"" long, 8-32 threaded machine screw and an 8-32 wingnut. This created two ""feet"" for the ball arm. Then I epoxied the two bracket ""feet"" to the fabric (upper) side of an old 1/4"" thick mousepad. Ta da. A friction pad for pennies with a ball arm attached.<br /><br />Works great. Cost was virtually nothing. Doesn't slide on either of the two dashboards I've tried it on. The mousepad is flexible and conforms easily to the curving shape of the various dashboards. It doesn't weigh much but the thick mousepad has enough heft to plant the getup nicely. The grippy rubber side of the mousepad adheres nicely to the dash. Yet I can pull it down to the floor quickly and reposition it easily.<br /><br />I wish I'd thought of this BEFORE I ordered this ""official"" friction mount to the tune of a couple of twenties.",4.0,i have a nuvi it came with a suction cup windshield mount it also came with a steel disk with double sticky adhesive on the back i was supposed to mount this disk somewhere on my dashboard then use the suction cup to attach the mount i didnt want to use the suction mount directly onto the windshield because it telegraphs the presence of an expensive gps unit its illegal in california to attach anything to the windshield and i dont think the suction cup would last very longbr br then theres the disk with the very permanent double sticky tape the problem with almost all cars these days is there really isnt anywhere to attach the disk discreetly every square inch is taken with existing stuff and who wants an ugly disk glued to the dash anyway and what if i want to use the gps in other vehicles more disksbr br so i settled on this beanbag mount with the ball mount armbr br unfortunately before the beanbag friction mount arrived i was flexing the arm in the suction cup mount and noticed the suction cups mounting bracket had already broken i had never even attached it to anything the mount is beautifully engineered and builtexcept for one area where the arms hinge pin attaches to the suction cups plastic hinge loops the loops are too thin and fragile the loops cracked and broke with hardly any hinging at allbr br so now i have a quite useless suction mount but a very functional ball arm what to dobr br i drove the hinge pin out of the ball arm then i took two small x steel angle brackets and attached them to the ball arm with a long threaded machine screw and an wingnut this created two feet for the ball arm then i epoxied the two bracket feet to the fabric upper side of an old thick mousepad ta da a friction pad for pennies with a ball arm attachedbr br works great cost was virtually nothing doesnt slide on either of the two dashboards ive tried it on the mousepad is flexible and conforms easily to the curving shape of the various dashboards it doesnt weigh much but the thick mousepad has enough heft to plant the getup nicely the grippy rubber side of the mousepad adheres nicely to the dash yet i can pull it down to the floor quickly and reposition it easilybr br i wish id thought of this before i ordered this official friction mount to the tune of a couple of twenties,2304
"I like the camera clip overall, it seems to be very well made and holds the camera securely, but there are several things that would make it so much better. 1. The space between the screws should be a bit wider. It is very difficult to attach it to a backpack strap as most straps are too wide. 2. It would be great if a hex hole was included in the thumb screws. It is very difficult to tighten the thumb screws. 3. Lack of coin slot on the screw that attaches the plate to the camera is disappointing. 4. The plate that attaches to the camera is Arca-Swiss compatible but will not work with most tripods.

"ok, so the installation was quite easy, and the provided directions do not give you specifics, nor do 3 of the 4 You Tube links provided, work.  All the components were provided, except the 3M sticky tape template on step 9 that allows you attach to your dash/etc.  I ordered the window suction cup separately, (Amazon) and it should be received Oct 19, 2021.<br /><br />That said, you can see in the first 5 pictures that I started with a Voyager brand fake camera cover on my Outback trailer, and as it turns out the wiring for a camera was already wired direct into the trailer running lights.  Check the polarity of your wires with a voltmeter.<br /><br />So I removed the cover plate, scraped off the old silicone, used stainless screws/washers to install the metal camera holder, directly onto the Voyager plastic plate.  I drilled an additional 4 small holes in the plate, and also put a rubber grommet in the center hole to run the cable through. I used liquid electrical tape to add additional moisture protection at the T terminals. Then waterproof silicone to seal it all up.<br /><br />The camera gauge wires are smaller than the trailer wiring, I believe they are 18 or 20 awg whereas the trailer is 16awg, so not a direct match.  Does not seem to be a big deal so far, but recommend Amtifo use a larger gauge to match typical US wiring systems.  I tested the system for connectivity before all wiring was completed, and it (pairing) did not go as smooth as I expected.  Numerous restarts and connection/pairing issues.<br /><br />The 6th picture is the final install - I used blue thread lock on the camera mount side screws because they would likely come loose at some point.  That again should be a recommendation in the instructions. The last picture was the first road trip, 60 mph, camera worked fine. However there is a greenish halo/haze at the bottom third of the screen, that I need to address with Evan at Amtifo customer service.  (He has responded to all 3 emails, timely)<br /><br />I have not tried the backup option yet, nor night driving, so will update accordingly later.  There was a final glitch after the road test - it was getting dark, I was backing the RV up, and could not see anything discernible.  Then the monitor went black after I pressed the on/off button, and when it came back on, I kept getting a blinking screen showing I needed an SD card.  Pretty random, eh?  I did not have a caed handy, so deferred to the next day. I could not even get to the startup screen, it just kept blinking.<br /><br />I informed Evan at Amtifo, and he asked what type vehicle I had (??) and what the voltage and current ""of the car"" was. Given the monitor and camera worked fine for 30 minutes on the test run, not sure why either question would be relevant to solving the ""blackout"".<br /><br />Day 2, found a card, installed it.  After running through the pairing steps twice again, including holding the monitor up close to the camera (used a 12v extension cord), I got them to pair and voila!! - a picture behind the RV!<br /><br />So apparently you have to have a card installed to make this all work, which is not stated in the instructions - or - there is an intermittent glitch in the monitor / camera pairing and the solution remains unknown.  At this point I am happy it works, the price point is pretty inexpensive for what you get, and there are a number of other brands that look identical to this unit, suggesting it is the same manufacturer in China but rebranded. They claim in the instruction manual, you can choose between a free 2nd camera, an SD card, or a cigarette lighter splitter, if you provide them a copy of your Amazon review - so here we are.<br /><br />I chose the camera, we shall see...I am also deferring purchase of a 7db extended antenna to attach to the camera and place on the RV roof, as I would first like to see if any reception issues occur on the next trip.  Some reviewers have noted they saw virtuallly no change in the video quality / reception.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Inexpensive solution to a trailering challenge (seeing behind and approaching sides)<br />- Easy install if you have at least basic DIY skills<br />- Quality of materials adequate for the purpose<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the screen buttons are not that responsive to finger touch, and I have concerns once the monitor is attached to the windshield suction cup - don't want to be fiddling with buttons to make them work when Im zipping down the highway with a load.<br />- The camera antenna provided is very short, and does not clear the roof of the RV (though they suggest to mount it up high or on the roof or over the center parking lights).  But who wants to drill more holes in their RV, or lose the center light?  Just provide an 8"" antenna - connectivity problem solved at close to zero added cost.<br />- the links in the instruction manual, pg 4 of the front side, clearly do not work, and you will get that msg from You Tube ""Video not, or no longer, available"".

Best of the three in these regards.  But the magnifications does not go that high.  Smaller details are visible on the EMARTH.  Theoretically they would be visible on the AmScope if the image quality was anything better than terrible.<br /><br />Lights both above and below the sample.  Intensities are independently adjustable (nice).<br /><br />The stage on this scope is more difficult to adjust.  Get the image in focus and let go of the knob and the stage ""relaxes"" to a new position, and the image goes out of focus.  A bit of tweaking will get a focused image, but shouldn't be necessary, and may frustrate a child.<br /><br />I am unsure of the total magnifications of the Swift.  The objectives are labeled 60X, 120X, and 200X.  Actual magnifications seem higher, although not nearly as high as the other two.<br /><br />I can see an argument being made that this microscope is the best of the three.because of the larger and brighter field of view, but the highest magnification level on the Swift is not enough.<br /><br />Frame is plastic.  No case.<br /><br />EMARTH:<br />Reasonably bright images.  Decent sized field of view.  The objective lens housings are made of metal - the other two have plastic lens housings.  This microscope also come with two eye pieces, one 10X and the other 25X.  Very quick to swap them for a different view.<br /><br />Switch for (1) Light from below, (2) Light from above, (3) Both.  Intensity is adjustable, but not independently Above/Below.<br /><br />Frame is plastic.  No case.  Instructions say to ""Use the dust cover provided by the microscope manufacturer...."" to protect the eye piece, but no dust cover was included.<br /><br />This is the best of the three.

"This is a Change from my One Star review earlier. I have a brand new Mac Mini with Sierra came on it, and it would not work. There were no instructions in the box. So I had to try several things and finally got it to work. I went to Logitech and downloaded the software available and installed them. Then I went to the Apple App store and put in Logitech and chose the Logitech Cam app and installed it too. Then I had to click on that one and it runs in the background and has a couple things you can change. I also opened the Gaming program too with more changes you can made in brightness, white balance and so on. (I am not using it for Gaming, just recording things for Youtube and my business.) You also have to go into SOUND and choose the webcam speakers. Then I used the Zoom Program (zoom.us) in order to record myself on this!  I had to go into settings there too... by Video arrow pointing up, and choose the 920 Webcam again.) When you do get it to work, it is very good quality. It just takes effort in Sierra. I did try using Quick Time as recommended on line, however, &#34;I&#34; was unable to make it work for me with Sierra. I did get it to work with this work around and wanted to share!!

"Since the [[ASIN:B009S4FMB6 Jabra SUPREME Driver's Edition Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Silver]] comes with a headband, I tend to use it with the headband.  Unfortunately, my hair is thinning because I lose some each time I remove the headset.  Regardless, this bluetooth is extremely easy to synch with my Droid and it's recognized each and every time I turn on the Bluetooth in the car.  I wear this only for driving and I don't care that passersby give me funny looks, it works great.  The earpiece is larger than most contemporary bluetooth devices, but it's cushiony and comfortable for long drives.  The microphone is sensitive and responsive.  I haven't had a complaint yet with any call.  Slipping the earphone onto the headband is a simple task, and I find that I'm wearing it 90% of the time, preferring that to the ear wire and no band.  My main criticism other than the hair pulling of this design is that it takes some getting used to to operate the touch controls as well as turn the device on and off.  When off of the band, it's an easy feat, but no so when it's attached and you can't bend the microphone down completely.  Since the battery is really long lasting, it hasn't run out of power yet in the middle of a call.  Because you have options for charging this set, you're a step ahead, and with an adjustable headband, it fits most head sizes.

"I like that the tripod completely folds into the bottom of the case. The case looks like it was well-constructed. It has pockets on both sides, and inside it has two padded dividers for putting in a camera and other small items such as lenses, extra camera batteries, small charger, lens cleaning accessories and filters.  This is not a large case by any means but for quick set up shoot, it is sufficient. I was able to put in a small video camera, two extra lenses and two extra batteries easily without using the outside pockets. It’s worth mentioning that this case doesn't have a lot of padding so you would want to be careful on how much you pack into it.<br /><br />The tripod is certainly sturdy and lightweight but fully extended it is about only about 55 inches. I wish this should have been at least 10 inches higher.

"We’ve had the Arlo Security System for about a week.  Installation was quick and easy.  I was able to connect the cameras to my home’s wi-fi and have the cameras up and running in under 15 minutes.  The cameras monitoring our garage doors and inside our home are working well.  However finding a good location for the camera monitoring our front door has been a challenge.  Because of the design of our front entrance, the only place we can install the camera is facing the walkway and stairs leading up to our front door.  Unfortunately because the cameras rely on thermal detection, a person coming directly towards the cameras is more difficult to detect. As a result, by the time the camera begins to record a delivery person, for example, the camera is only able to capture the individual departing (his or her back).  The person walking up to the front door and delivering the package is never captured on video.  We have tried changing the camera's sensitivity settings but that has not helped much.  Hopefully we will find a good compromise for the front door camera otherwise we will have to find another product that works better.",4.0,weve had the arlo security system for about a week installation was quick and easy i was able to connect the cameras to my homes wifi and have the cameras up and running in under minutes the cameras monitoring our garage doors and inside our home are working well however finding a good location for the camera monitoring our front door has been a challenge because of the design of our front entrance the only place we can install the camera is facing the walkway and stairs leading up to our front door unfortunately because the cameras rely on thermal detection a person coming directly towards the cameras is more difficult to detect as a result by the time the camera begins to record a delivery person for example the camera is only able to capture the individual departing his or her back the person walking up to the front door and delivering the package is never captured on video we have tried changing the cameras sensitivity settings but that has not helped much hopefully we will find a good compromise for the front door camera otherwise we will have to find another product that works better,1106

"These headphones sound very nice (seems like they don't quite live up to my Image S4s, but close, and they're not broken in yet).

I do not have a small head or neck, but with the cable in front of my neck, it reaches down to my upper-chest.

"So far my kids and I are enjoying using our echo dot.  They've been able to call their grandma just by telling Alexa to make the call.  They get a kick out of it.  And my son likes the jokes she tells when you ask for a joke.  I've used the alarm feature for baking and cook times. One thing we haven't done yet is used any of the smart devices to link to Alexa.  I'd like to do the bulbs in each room so I can control them from anywhere with the app.  My only negative thing to say about it so far is that sometimes she randomly comes on as though someone said ""Alexa"" when nobody said anything remotely close.

This is a great graphics card for the media center PC I built specifically for playback of streaming video from a NAS server in my office to the small quiet PC in the living room.  The Plus is that both Audio and Video stream through the HDMI port on this card making it a perfect solution for playback of video for the budget price of this card.  Plays perfect 1080p streams so this card fit my purposes perfectly.  The draw back is that the card doesn't do much more than that.,4.0,this is a great graphics card for the media center pc i built specifically for playback of streaming video from a nas server in my office to the small quiet pc in the living room the plus is that both audio and video stream through the hdmi port on this card making it a perfect solution for playback of video for the budget price of this card plays perfect p streams so this card fit my purposes perfectly the draw back is that the card doesnt do much more than that,467

"My very first GPS devise was Garmin nuvi 1490 with which I had very good experience. When I lost this machine, I chose to buy this 40 LM model. This device features a 4.3"" touchscreen and provides accurate, turn-by-turn directions that speak street names. The Qwerty keypad is a cool design; you can plug in the destination address or use other search criteria to find restaurants, hospitals and other important local information. It also includes free lifetime map updates, which I did not have with nuvi 1490 purchase. At the time of purchase, it comes with preloaded maps of the lower 49 States and other accessories such as suction cup holder for attachment to windshield and 12 volt power cable. This model does not feature traffic conditions which are available on other models like nuvi 1490. Based on my experience with 1490; I can say that the traffic conditions reported by a Garmin GPS devise is a suspect and unreliable.

Really, once you figure out what size earpiece you need, I see no need to carry the others. Now,  fit and comfortability. These earpieces are SO comfortable, soft, and easy to fit into the ear. The medium size that where installed out of the box fit me perfectly. The power button on top of the right side was very easy to feel and operate. The right side of the cord houses the function button piece and microphone for calls. Unlike some wireless headphones I've tried, this function piece is very light and doesn't feel &#34;weighty&#34; on that side at all. The sound is very good. When the music goes silent, I did hear a very slight buzzing in the background, but it didn't really detract when listening. The only drawbacks were that the app did not have an equalizer function to adjust the tone.

Just finished a long trip and it handled everything very well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- quality<br />- zoom and lens<br />- fits in my pocket<br />- ability to download to phone over Wifi<br /><br />Cons:<br />- occasionally changed some random setting by accident and had to figure out how to undo. This was annoying<br />- app is a bit clumsy and old school and disallows download to a cloud drive or options.

"This is a very nice Blu-ray player.  There are a lot of choices out there.

"For the record: I hate this trend in mobile phones to push us away from a standard 3.5mm jack. I tried to hold onto a phone that had one for as long as I could, but when my Galaxy S10 had to go, I needed an adapter.

But I think the jack might be TRS and not TRRS.

"As we got this in a four pack, everyone in the family who had devices with screens immediately got one to put to use. Everyone agreed that this screen cleaner did an excellent job on small screens, like phones and tablets. I found that it wasn't as good on larger screens though. On 1920x1080 full size desktop screens, the cleaner was more awkward to use and  was more prone to streaking and such. One nice thing though is that the spray had no chemical smell. In fact, it didn't have any discernible odor at all. Our techie teen figured out how to get the bottle out so it can be refilled when necessary. I did have a little trouble figuring out how the stand work and I wondered why a screen cleaner needed an attached stand. As it turns out, I'm glad it has one. It works very nicely for my 10"" tablet. The family consensus was to give this product a 4 star rating because it worked so well on small screens and because the stand actually turned out to be useful. The fact that it was less effective on larger screens and that it is a bit pricey are the reasons it didn't get a full 5 stars. Our family liked this screen cleaner.

"This is a standard, run of the mill USB external drive. It's compact (measures about 3 inches wide, 5 inches long and roughly one-half inch thick). It's powered by the USB port, and includes a short (8 inch) cable. It's a nice-looking device - glossy black, and feels substantial.<br /><br />The biggest difference I've seen is that it does not come loaded with any software. That's a huge plus in my book - I returned a Toshiba drive since it really put up a fight when I tried to bypass loading its software. My usual brand (Seagate) is nicer in that it allows you to bypass the software install, but the Maxell approach is the best: don't have any to begin with! The software that comes with these drives is, at best, superfluous. At worse, it is a source of interference/conflict with other software. So Maxell gets a big thumbs up for taking the no software approach.<br /><br />Speed is decent. I didn't notice any measurable difference between it and a similar Seagate drive.<br /><br />My dislikes are the short cord. While it may be fine for a laptop, it's cumbersome for a desktop. A 12 to 18 inch cord would have been welcomed.<br /><br />My concern is regarding support. Although I had zero problems installing and using this, I went to the Maxell site to see how their support was. I couldn't even find this product listed - they have a lot of products, but no category for external hard drives. A search of the model number on their site produced no hits.<br /><br />I imagine this is a new market for Maxell, and they are putting their name on a drive produced by someone else (total guess on my part). In any case, not even having the product listed on their website is concerning to me should I have the need for support in the future.<br /><br />[UPDATE DEC 2011: Hard drives are now listed on the support section of the Maxell site, so support may no longer be an issue of concern.]<br /><br />But, other than the short cord, I've had no problems and would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to avoid fighting with their external drive when it insists on loading unnecessary software.",4.0,this is a standard run of the mill usb external drive its compact measures about inches wide inches long and roughly onehalf inch thick its powered by the usb port and includes a short inch cable its a nicelooking device glossy black and feels substantialbr br the biggest difference ive seen is that it does not come loaded with any software thats a huge plus in my book i returned a toshiba drive since it really put up a fight when i tried to bypass loading its software my usual brand seagate is nicer in that it allows you to bypass the software install but the maxell approach is the best dont have any to begin with the software that comes with these drives is at best superfluous at worse it is a source of interferenceconflict with other software so maxell gets a big thumbs up for taking the no software approachbr br speed is decent i didnt notice any measurable difference between it and a similar seagate drivebr br my dislikes are the short cord while it may be fine for a laptop its cumbersome for a desktop a to inch cord would have been welcomedbr br my concern is regarding support although i had zero problems installing and using this i went to the maxell site to see how their support was i couldnt even find this product listed they have a lot of products but no category for external hard drives a search of the model number on their site produced no hitsbr br i imagine this is a new market for maxell and they are putting their name on a drive produced by someone else total guess on my part in any case not even having the product listed on their website is concerning to me should i have the need for support in the futurebr br update dec hard drives are now listed on the support section of the maxell site so support may no longer be an issue of concernbr br but other than the short cord ive had no problems and would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to avoid fighting with their external drive when it insists on loading unnecessary software,1984

"I purchased this to copy old VHS tapes to DVDs. It was easy to setup and operate. If your VHS tapes are all 2 hr SP (Standard Play) you should have no problems. I was able to successfully copy over 50 VHS tapes that were 20+ years old. At the recommendation of others, I used these DVD-R disk without a single issue.<br />[[ASIN:B007BL1R9O CMC Pro - Powered by TY Technology Premium Blank DVD - 8x 4.7GB DVD-R Silver Thermal in Cake Box - 100 Pack]]<br /><br />I did run into problems when changing the recording mode from SP to LP and SP to EP. The resulting DVDs ended up with a distorted aspect ratio (which is why I'm deducting 1 star). I ended up recording the 2+ hr VHS tapes onto multiple DVDs.<br /><br />I was only able to eject VHS tapes using the remote by hitting the VCR button followed by the eject button. Doing the same on the recorder would only open/close the DVD tray.<br /><br />Another minor problem that I encountered was with a tape that had a copy-once broadcast program (some movie) on it that had been recorded over with family events. The family events were taped over multiple days and had a few seconds of the copy-once movie in between. The Funai Recorded would stop dubbing any time the copy protected scenes were detected. This was a minor annoyance that I thankfully only had to deal with twice.<br /><br />The only other issue I had was with a couple VHS tapes that were recorded in Hi-Fi stereo. When playing these tapes there was no sound coming through the TV. If this happens, you need to<br />1. Have the VHS tape playing then<br />2. Press the DVD button on the remote then<br />3. Press the Audio button on the remote to change the sound to MONO. You should hear sound now.<br />Now you can stop the VHS tape and rewind it, then start the dubbing process. The sound will now be recorded on the DVD. Note that the Funai Recorded will not remember this setting. The next time you put in a VHS tape you will need to repeat these steps if necessary.<br /><br />Steps Required to Copy a VHS Tape to DVD (assuming VHS is 2 hrs long)<br />1. Insert VHS tape and a blank DVD-R disk. The order does not matter.<br />2. Play the VHS tape to check for audio. Stop or pause the tape a few seconds before the point you want to record.<br />3. Press the red D.Dubbing button on the remote to start the VHS to DVD copy process.<br />4. Press the Stop button when you are done recording or wait for the Funai Recorded to automatically stop. Every time you start and stop the dubbing process you create a separate title menu on the DVD. This is nice if you have the patience to separate out different events recorded on the same VHS tape.<br />5.

"I got this system to keep an eye on my carport, shop, and front porch, and have been very happy with it so far. The 8 channel system came with 4 cameras but I'm only using 3 for now, pending decision on location of the 4th.<br />The POE system was ultra simple & straightforward to install. Configuration was also easy, in spite of the poorly written and outdated instructions. The PDF QR image directs to an outdated app, but the QR on the DVR points to the correct one. I had difficulty getting the cameras to show up on their app. An email to customer service ultimately got me up & running, but only after the usual back-and-forth with multiple customer support personnel. The 2nd person that responded to my email acted like they had not even bothered to read my initial email, giving me ""help"" that was not applicable to my issue. This is when I found out about the outdated app. Once the correct one was installed, it was working except for 1 camera, which was working on the DVR display. They sent me a link to a firmware update, which took care of the issue. There is a button on the DVR setup menu that is supposed to check for an update. I had clicked this button a couple times over the course of setup & just general messing around, but it always reported that there was no update available, and I was running the current version. Apparently this feature does not work properly. I am initially giving 5-stars for motion detection, although I've yet to fine-tune it. The night vision lights attract bugs, moths, etc. so there is more perceived activity to the system. It doesn't seem like it would be possible to filter out this type of motion detection, so it is what it is.

"I am writing this review a little later as I have owned the Senso wireless headphones for over a year and just recently purchased a pair of Beats Wireless Headphones.  At the price, you can not beat these Senso headphones.  In fact, there are only 3 noticeable areas where Beats are slightly better:<br />1. The quality of the plastic that fits around the ear.  Only wish, it was stronger on the Senso<br />2. The quality of the sound and volume. I found Beats, for all their hype, are only slightly better<br />3. The ability to skip to the next song without using my device. Senso doesn't have it, Beats does<br /><br />I bought my Beats for $99 on Black Friday deal which is a decent savings (normally $199). I will say that at $27 for the Senso vs. the normal price of $199 for Beats ... SENSO wins that price comparison hands down.<br /><br />If you want a pair of good under $30 wireless headphones.

The Panasonic RB-M500B Deep Base Head Phones are very well made with great battery life.  The battery lasted a lot longer then I expected per charge.  The sound quality is clear if not a little lower sometimes but the bass adjust button is amazing at bringing a full sounding bass while not taking away from quality and clarity.  The larger than normal ear pieces fit quite comfortably and do not push against the head too much at all.  While the buttons blend in seamlessly they are hard to navigate your fingers to operate while listening. Overall a great headset and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair for a reasonable price.,4.0,the panasonic rbmb deep base head phones are very well made with great battery life the battery lasted a lot longer then i expected per charge the sound quality is clear if not a little lower sometimes but the bass adjust button is amazing at bringing a full sounding bass while not taking away from quality and clarity the larger than normal ear pieces fit quite comfortably and do not push against the head too much at all while the buttons blend in seamlessly they are hard to navigate your fingers to operate while listening overall a great headset and i would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair for a reasonable price,636

"I'm really enjoying this little tablet/laptop. I would have to say that it's more of a tablet than a laptop as the keyboard is not needed to use the machine. First off, the tablet portion, is extremely heavy especially for how small it is. I can't see myself holding this up for long periods of time. Also, the keyboard is extremely light and feels pretty cheap. Sometimes if you don't have the tablet at the right angle, it tips over backwards because the tablet is so much heavier than the keyboard.<br /><br />I do like the different ways that you can attach the keyboard to the tablet, and the different positions that allows you to use the laptop in, but I feel like that's just a plus and not something that is extremely important, at least for me.<br /><br />I also like that is windows based, giving you some more options for what you can do with it as opposed to apple or android machines, but I hate that it is windows 8. I do not like windows 8 at all, I find it confusing and not user friendly.<br /><br />This makes a great secondary laptop and would be wonderful for travel with it's compact size. It would probably be very useful for people who do some of their business outside of the office and need a small laptop to use as a backup.",4.0,im really enjoying this little tabletlaptop i would have to say that its more of a tablet than a laptop as the keyboard is not needed to use the machine first off the tablet portion is extremely heavy especially for how small it is i cant see myself holding this up for long periods of time also the keyboard is extremely light and feels pretty cheap sometimes if you dont have the tablet at the right angle it tips over backwards because the tablet is so much heavier than the keyboardbr br i do like the different ways that you can attach the keyboard to the tablet and the different positions that allows you to use the laptop in but i feel like thats just a plus and not something that is extremely important at least for mebr br i also like that is windows based giving you some more options for what you can do with it as opposed to apple or android machines but i hate that it is windows i do not like windows at all i find it confusing and not user friendlybr br this makes a great secondary laptop and would be wonderful for travel with its compact size it would probably be very useful for people who do some of their business outside of the office and need a small laptop to use as a backup,1201

"I got this in a military store because I am constantly traveling and wanted a lighter laptop to stay in touch. Startup and shutdown are quicker than on larger laptops. I'm glad there is more than enough hard drive storage but the included battery could be larger. The 3-cell is actually perfect for the form but it only lasts about 2.5 hours of heavy use. I ordered a 6-cell to become my primary battery but the back sticks out and ruins the smooth look of the form. Some people complained about the buttons being on opposite sides of the touchpad but it hasn't made any difference to the work I do since I use a mouse, which came with the computer. The only other drawback is the screen resolution. You have to be careful about loading any games that require a greater resolution than 1024 x 600. I have several favorites that can't be loaded on this. However, Corel WordPerfect Suite X3 and Microsoft Office 2007 loaded just fine. It also comes with InterVideo WinDVD but it is only a trial edition-it used to be free-so I downloaded iTunes. There isn't much bloatware so it didn't take long for me to get rid of what I didn't want. All in all, this is a great buy for a road warrior.

"I really like the design but it comes with some consideration. There wasn't much guidance on how to set this up so took me a while to figure out how to ''activate'' all the charging portals. There are two USB charging ports and two tri-prong regular outlets. I have a charging station that is usually plugged by 4-6 devices and it's always a mess. They didn't work perfectly for my need but these are sleek design, perfect for personal office organization. However, the charging cord is very thick and storage boxes are light, so you can easily tilt any of the parts and I needed my Echo to keep the portals stay. The storage box is enough to keep your keys and a few post-its which are very nice to hide your tiny junks. I also really like how easy it is for your to clean the pen holder, but not the device holder. I didn't appreciate their warranty policy.

The  keyboard is a comfortable size, and it's arranged intelligently. They keys are responsive, and the trackpad works well. I like that it's so thin, too, yet it doesn't feel flimsy. The whole, when the keyboard is folded closed, is still remarkably thin. I haven't a lot of experience with convertibles, but it separates into its components without great difficulty once you try it a couple of times--but it feels like it's built to last. It doesn't swing in a wide arc, due to it's magnetic hinge assembly, but I don't find that to be a major irritation. If that changes I'll try to edit this review. Even with the keyboard on, it's easy to use the touch functions as though it were just a tablet. The screen has good color and definitely adequate resolution. I haven't done any serious photo editing on it as that's a function that will be better performed on my desktop, but I haven't felt any lack when it comes to photo viewing on it. I like its weight, and find myself carrying the whole around most of the time.<br /><br />No, for its price it doesn't come with MS Office, but I'm generally happy with the freeware office products out there--but if you want to pay for your office software, be my guest. After coming to depend on a smaller tablet, and finding the frustrations of a tiny screen, this one is a real pleasure. It's big enough I can read the default fonts easily, and even manage to select the proper choice on drop-down menus when it's just a tablet.<br /><br />A good investment, and reasonably priced, that's been well thought out.<br /><br />Updated June 2016:<br />Okay, this tablet has some things I don't love, and I've reduced my rating to four stars.<br /><br />The physical button arrangement is less convenient than other tablets, with the volume button on the side, so to adjust volume I have to use my other hand to counter-balance the pressure on the volume. If it were on the top, with the power switch, this wouldn't be an issue, at least when it's got the keyboard attached and I'm using it laptop style.<br /><br />Perhaps it's just mine, but sometimes I have to start it twice, as it hangs up in the boot process. Also, the touch functionality gets tangled up with the mouse, and I'll have to use the touchpad to complete an action.<br /><br />It's still my preferred device, and I use it all the time.

Purchased these replacement pads in hope that they might fit my headphones - which has pads that are disintegrating - leastwise the outer leather part. The headphones I have are a pair of Pioneer Hi-Res Over-Ear Headphones - SE-MS5T. I've been looking for a set of replacement pads - but haven't found any that are specifically for that set of headphones. So I took a chance and ordered a pair of these. Unfortunately they are too small to fit. About 15% smaller in size than what I need.<br /><br />The replacement pads seem to be of good quality - and I think they would have been a more than adequate replacement if they had fit. I'm going to keep these in case I need them later as I have other headphones that they might fit.

"I had bought a bunch of these years ago, but you can no longer find them and I've yet to find something similar.  This actually worked quite well allowing you to specify your skin type and SPF you have on.  It then measures the UV and starts a countdown timer of how long you can be exposed before you will burn.  The problem is it's a battery powered device with an LCD display that you're supposed to leave in the sun. Unfortunately that same sun causes the device and LCD to overheat to point where it becomes damaged and fails.

"Anker comes through again. What I was looking for was a Bluetooth earphone that had a long battery life and these Anchor SoundBuds deliver. Sound wise they are sound pretty good, not as good as my Etymotic wire earphones but quiet good considering the limitations of the BlueTooth on my iPhone 7+.  They also instantly pair up with my iPhone. The battery life is impressive I have been 11 hours and they still are not signalling for a refresh. The SoundBuds are well constructed. I like the fact the charging port is located on the control module on the cross cable. The control module is larger than most and the control buttons are widely spaced making their use out of sight easy. The ear pieces fit well and for me very comfortable for extended periods of time. I have not had to screw them around to get a proper seal for the best sound. I have purchased a lot of earphones of this design these are the best.<br /><br />Update. 17 Oct 2017.

"As a Mac user, I was really surprised by how much I liked this PC. It’s quite capable for almost every use case I threw at it, other than maybe hard-core gaming.  It had been a while since I regularly used a Windows based machine, and Windows 10 really impressed me. Integration with Office365 was flawless.<br /><br />The CPU was plenty fast, even for applications like Photoshop.  For browsing, word processing, or image editing, I had no slowdowns that made me wish I had a faster CPU.<br /><br />I was also impressed by the screen. It’s the first laptop I’ve owned with a touchscreen and the ability to essentially turn itself into a tablet.  I was impressed by how well Windows 10 handled that transition. Overall, I think it’s a really nice screen.  I haven’t used the included stylus much, but it was responsive enough when I tested it out.  I’m just not sure I’ll have much reason to use it. The touchscreen also is another novelty I'm not sure will be all that useful for me in the long run, but I could see how many people would enjoy it.<br /><br />Battery life was really good, I thought.  I think some of that has to do with how well Windows 10 manages power compared to past versions.<br /><br />And now for some negatives: it’s definitely heavier than I was expecting.

"[[VIDEOID:842229ac2eae9c7bf58c428f875692c4]] I have owned this TV for approximately 16 months and have deliberately waited to post a review to ensure it is accurate and not based on an initial honeymoon period after purchase.  It was also purchased within weeks of a similar LG smart TV which is used for comparison.<br /><br />I am not a tech person and I rate this as four stars based on functionality for the average user, nor am I someone who likes to game or values an intense movie experience.  The TV installed quickly and was mounted to a wall mount with no additional hardware needed.  The picture quality is excellent and we use to stream in HD on Netflix, Prime, and Disney+.  Sound is also great.  There are two parts of this TV that I like most.  First is the internet connectivity which has never disconnected.  The WiFi connection for our LG TV constantly disconnected to the point we plugged in a Fire TV stick.  The WiFi connectivity of this Toshiba is refreshingly problem free and it has never disconnected.  The second part of this TV that I like is the simplicity of the remote.  It is basically a Fire TV remote and isn't overly complex like the LG remote.  Navigation of the TV settings and controls is also easy.

"The concept of building degrees of surround sound is pretty cool--nice use of bluetooth, and had the sound quality been better, it would probably be a worthwhile investment since it works with every device I have tried it with (iPhone, iPad, a few laptops).

Once paired, the devices find themselves easily and it's no longer an issue.<br />As for the sound, it's a little tinny and doesn't carry as far as other brands in my home (Pioneer and Bose), and considering this one isn't that much cheaper, it might be worthwhile paying the extra hundred or so dollars for one of the leading brands; however, the fact these can be paired with each other to create surround sound does make a compelling argument for buying them.<br />Interesting and useful product with decent but not excellent sound.",4.0,the concept of building degrees of surround sound is pretty coolnice use of bluetooth and had the sound quality been better it would probably be a worthwhile investment since it works with every device i have tried it with iphone ipad a few laptops the initial setup isnt quite as straightforward as pressing a button and waiting for it to show on the other devices screen but its not horrible either it just requires a little reading in the instruction book once paired the devices find themselves easily and its no longer an issuebr as for the sound its a little tinny and doesnt carry as far as other brands in my home pioneer and bose and considering this one isnt that much cheaper it might be worthwhile paying the extra hundred or so dollars for one of the leading brands however the fact these can be paired with each other to create surround sound does make a compelling argument for buying thembr interesting and useful product with decent but not excellent sound,973

"I used this to hook up my xDuoo TA-30 to the wall receptacle.  It delivers power and sounds good (it already sounded good using the included ~ $1 cable).  It looks sweet, especially with the steam punk look of the giant rectifier and pre amp tubes.  All in all, not bad for the price.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1) it's ridiculously impractical--the thick and stiff cable starts to pull the very hefty xDuoo TA-30, and the cable's limited flexibility limits placement.  This makes the 1M length a bit misleading, as you lose 1/3 the length to large radius turns from a table/shelf/desk to vertical and back to horizontal for the outlet.  This also means that the unit needs to be away from the edge and wall and likewise the cord sticks out far from the wall.  It's a usability nightmare.<br />2) Have you ever seen the wires that go through your walls, how they are connected to each other, and the overall power grid leading to your home?  Is the step down transformer in the neighborhood audiophile grade?  Is the copper in your walls OFC?  Probably not.<br /><br />Anyway, if it weren't so hard to place, the good looks would still suffice, but I kinda hate this due to that issue.",4.0,i used this to hook up my xduoo ta to the wall receptacle it delivers power and sounds good it already sounded good using the included cable it looks sweet especially with the steam punk look of the giant rectifier and pre amp tubes all in all not bad for the pricebr br howeverbr br its ridiculously impracticalthe thick and stiff cable starts to pull the very hefty xduoo ta and the cables limited flexibility limits placement this makes the m length a bit misleading as you lose the length to large radius turns from a tableshelfdesk to vertical and back to horizontal for the outlet this also means that the unit needs to be away from the edge and wall and likewise the cord sticks out far from the wall its a usability nightmarebr have you ever seen the wires that go through your walls how they are connected to each other and the overall power grid leading to your home is the step down transformer in the neighborhood audiophile grade is the copper in your walls ofc probably notbr br anyway if it werent so hard to place the good looks would still suffice but i kinda hate this due to that issue,1104

"-  First off, as of July 2014, you can get this sweet baby NEW on clearance for 749 at BB...hurry up and get there already! before the 10% reward points bonus is over.<br />-  I actually bought an open box demo and saved myself an extra Franklin.  I was planing to get a 42in til I saw the deal on this puppy...couldn't pass it up! I have had this a few weeks now and ready to spring a review.<br />-  I read an online review while I was scrutinizing it on the showroom floor. All the cons the author talked about like ghosting and and poor viewing angles seemed completely fabricated to me...maybe he cut and pasted from the 2008 model or something. This TV is very capable...it rocks!<br />-  Unbelievable bargain for those Few that happen to use a PS3, Xbox, Roku, etc, etc to add &#34;smartness&#34; to their TV viewing. No apps on this one...no upcharge either.  No Problem at all watching Amazon Prime thru my PSx.<br />- I actually prefer the VIVID setting (as they had it set in the store) for my viewing, even though my room is darlk...I like colors to pop! Vivid is good eXpecially for 3D content which seems to dim the picture down about 30-50%...I didn't expect that with active 3D glasses. I always heard that passive cuts the light in half, but apparently so does active 3D.<br />- I am really impressed with the ability of the panel to deliver &#34;synthetic&#34; 3D from whatever you are watching. However, after an hour I tend to get a headache, so I use it sparingly. I'll update again after I watch an actual Hobbit 3D bluray this week. I did not notice any ghosting either. I like the 3D button on the remote which skips the menus.<br />- I have to admit, the remote and the features on this TV could use some work. My Sharp Aquos has a &#34;view&#34; button that allows me to flip through a few screen fitting adjustments and I have never had a problem getting what I like out of it to easily fit on the screen. I find myself watching a lot of 720p content on this TV in a smaller boxed area, If you magnify it, then its too big to fit on the screen and you lose content. That just seems stupid to me...if Sharp can do it, why can't Samsung? I also like all the shortcut buttons on the Sharp remote, where with Samsung I feel I am spending waay too much time in the menus to get things done.<br />-  The speakers are actually impressive for 8 watts, that being said...they should have been at least 15 watts. I have it on 45 volume if the aircon is on, any louder than that, it starts to get distortion. So they definitely skimped on the speakers a bit more than they should have. This TV is my travel partner, so no surround system is going to accompany me to hotels or temporary living sites. One thing I have considered, is using the headphone jack with a set of PC speakers...if I get that setup I will update the review about how that worked out.<br />- I have not done much gaming on it yet, but so far it seems fine. I will update if I see any lag problems. I typically play mostly RPG's where that is rarely a big issue.<br />-  All-in-all I have No deal-breaking complaints about the TV so I am giving it 4 stars. Based on price it could possibly be a quarter to half a point more than that. Too bad they don't have a 1 to 10 scale on amazon. It definitely helps sooth my Sharp Aquos withdrawal pangs when I am working away from home.",4.0,first off as of july you can get this sweet baby new on clearance for at bbhurry up and get there already before the reward points bonus is overbr i actually bought an open box demo and saved myself an extra franklin i was planing to get a in til i saw the deal on this puppycouldnt pass it up i have had this a few weeks now and ready to spring a reviewbr i read an online review while i was scrutinizing it on the showroom floor all the cons the author talked about like ghosting and and poor viewing angles seemed completely fabricated to memaybe he cut and pasted from the model or something this tv is very capableit rocksbr unbelievable bargain for those few that happen to use a ps xbox roku etc etc to add smartness to their tv viewing no apps on this oneno upcharge either no problem at all watching amazon prime thru my psxbr i actually prefer the vivid setting as they had it set in the store for my viewing even though my room is darlki like colors to pop vivid is good expecially for d content which seems to dim the picture down about i didnt expect that with active d glasses i always heard that passive cuts the light in half but apparently so does active dbr i am really impressed with the ability of the panel to deliver synthetic d from whatever you are watching however after an hour i tend to get a headache so i use it sparingly ill update again after i watch an actual hobbit d bluray this week i did not notice any ghosting either i like the d button on the remote which skips the menusbr i have to admit the remote and the features on this tv could use some work my sharp aquos has a view button that allows me to flip through a few screen fitting adjustments and i have never had a problem getting what i like out of it to easily fit on the screen i find myself watching a lot of p content on this tv in a smaller boxed area if you magnify it then its too big to fit on the screen and you lose content that just seems stupid to meif sharp can do it why cant samsung i also like all the shortcut buttons on the sharp remote where with samsung i feel i am spending waay too much time in the menus to get things donebr the speakers are actually impressive for watts that being saidthey should have been at least watts i have it on volume if the aircon is on any louder than that it starts to get distortion so they definitely skimped on the speakers a bit more than they should have this tv is my travel partner so no surround system is going to accompany me to hotels or temporary living sites one thing i have considered is using the headphone jack with a set of pc speakersif i get that setup i will update the review about how that worked outbr i have not done much gaming on it yet but so far it seems fine i will update if i see any lag problems i typically play mostly rpgs where that is rarely a big issuebr allinall i have no dealbreaking complaints about the tv so i am giving it stars based on price it could possibly be a quarter to half a point more than that too bad they dont have a to scale on amazon it definitely helps sooth my sharp aquos withdrawal pangs when i am working away from home,3130

"I don't have much experience with A/V items, but It's something I've been interested in for a while and wanted to explore the hobby.  I like to try to capture as much video as i can on my iPhone 6, but the problem is that my LifeProof case adds some bulk to the phone itself and won't allow the VideoMic Me fit without removing the case.. OR using the extension / connector provided by LifeProof.  But the problem with that is you loose some sturdiness with the fitting on the case.

"I really like how well this holds.  This is not the highest end tripod mount in the world, but it will definitely do what's needed.

"I ordered the 'Soundcore Wakey Bluetooth Speaker Powered by Anker with Alarm Clock, Stereo Sound, FM Radio, White Noise, QI Wireless Charger with 7.5W Charging for iPhone and 10W for Samsung' for review and would like to share some of my thoughts after a few weeks.<br /><br />First off, this thing is actually pretty amazing. The build quality is nice and aesthetically it looks clean. The sound quality is nice but not phenomenal. However for how small it is, it does produce decent sound and for a bedside alarm clock it does quite well. The wireless charging works great for my Galaxy Note 8 (and does in fact Fast-Charge) however there have been a couple nights to where my phone was not charged the next morning. The fast charger also works with my wireless earbuds which I attached an image showing the charge light on the Wakey, and the wireless earbuds case indicating charging. However for the wireless earbud charging, it does take some precise positioning to get them to charge. I noticed in other review that others weren't happy with the bright display light with no way to adjust it any dimmer than the lowest setting, however they must have updated that with a firmware update (which was super easy to do) as I had no issues with the display being too bright at night. I use the auto adjust setting which seems to work quite well as far as I can tell. Also I love the sleep mode sounds that you can adjust several (or just one) sound volumes to create your own personalized preference. I do wish that there were more sound options but the ones they provide are acceptable. I also wish that you could download and install more alarm sounds. Bluetooth connectivity is super quick and have never once had an issue with pairing it up to my phone. Really the ONLY issue I have with the Wakey is that to get the sleep mode sounds going, you need to connect with the app, and via Bluetooth connect to the device. No big deal right? Well my concern is that you will need to keep it connected for this feature to work. This means you will be connected to the Wakey ALL night and this kind of bugs me. It's just kind of creepy that the Wakey is connected to your phone all night while you sleep. I wish there was a way to just play your favorite white noise sleep sound by pressing a button on the Wakey device without having to always connect and stay connected to the app and your phone. The other gripe is that the plug design is huge and makes it so that I have had to move my nightstand further way from the wall to use it. Other than those two  gripes, and the only reason for docking one star, the Soundcore Wakey is a very good product and a really great value.<br />*On a side note - I just tested the Wakey while watching some Youtube videos and the latency is not so good.

"With spending so much time working from home I was missing the 1440 monitors I have in my office, but I didn't want to spend too much money.  This monitor is a good compromise.  It's not as good as the VP2770 in my office or a comparable professional series, but it does have a crisp clear display and is lighter weight with a flatter bezel.  Since I'm using this for software development I can't comment on refresh rates as I'm not a gamer, but I would highly recommend this for office work.  Unfortunately I have 2 pixels out, which is below what is covered under their warranty.  It makes it look like there's a spec of dust on the screen, but for the most part it's hard to notice.  It's definitely an upgrade over the 23"" 1080 display I was using before and I'm glad I upgraded.<br /><br />Update: 2 years later and I'm still happy with this monitor.

"My rating is my first impression of the entire package, without knowing how well the battery itself will hold up. The battery was a higher capacity than the original, and physically larger. There was space in the DEZL 770 for the larger battery, that had been filled by a plastic card the original battery was stuck to.<br /><br />The original was an 1100 mAH single-cell Lithium, while the replacement was a 1500 mAH of the same voltage. The Torx driver included appears to be a T6, while the 770 required a T9, which I already had. The pry tool included is something I'll probably use again. It does the job and seems to be made of quality materials. The disc included was for a DEZL 760, which is very similar, and possibly explains the incorrect driver.<br /><br />The Garmin powered up and is currently charging fine. The original battery would only last about 5 minutes, which wasn't critical, but the device was occasionally resetting while plugged in and tracking, which I'm hoping was due to the battery being at the end of its life. Considering the price of this battery, compared to buying a new GPS, this is really a bargain if it solves the issue. If not, it'll still be a good spare if I buy a new device, with a good battery.<br /><br />I can't comment on the video disc included, because I didn't use it. Replacing the battery isn't difficult, but does require some care. For someone who's never done something like this before, it might be a good idea to get a 10-year-old to help. I've been taking things apart for at least 55 years, and most of the time can put them back together. My philosophy relies on the fact that if it's not working now, I can't either fix it, or screw it up bad enough that it'll need to be replaced.",4.0,my rating is my first impression of the entire package without knowing how well the battery itself will hold up the battery was a higher capacity than the original and physically larger there was space in the dezl for the larger battery that had been filled by a plastic card the original battery was stuck tobr br the original was an mah singlecell lithium while the replacement was a mah of the same voltage the torx driver included appears to be a t while the required a t which i already had the pry tool included is something ill probably use again it does the job and seems to be made of quality materials the disc included was for a dezl which is very similar and possibly explains the incorrect driverbr br the garmin powered up and is currently charging fine the original battery would only last about minutes which wasnt critical but the device was occasionally resetting while plugged in and tracking which im hoping was due to the battery being at the end of its life considering the price of this battery compared to buying a new gps this is really a bargain if it solves the issue if not itll still be a good spare if i buy a new device with a good batterybr br i cant comment on the video disc included because i didnt use it replacing the battery isnt difficult but does require some care for someone whos never done something like this before it might be a good idea to get a yearold to help ive been taking things apart for at least years and most of the time can put them back together my philosophy relies on the fact that if its not working now i cant either fix it or screw it up bad enough that itll need to be replaced,1642

"Firstly, the important thing to know about this cover is that it simply goes over the existing padding on the Rift S.  That means it doesn't provide extra cushioning, but it DOES increase the surface area so I'd argue it is a bit more comfortable.  However, because it just sort of sits on top, it isn't very secure, especially the forehead area which I find sometimes slides upwards during intense play sessions.  It would be nice to see an improved design that secures a bit better.<br /><br />Secondly, the silicon is both a pro and a con.  Obviously, the benefit that most want from this is ease of cleaning and not absorbing sweat.  This definitely covers both those areas just fine.  However, being silicon, it doesn't breathe and I've found that it actually makes me sweat more than usual and, while I need to play a bit more to say for certain, seemed to cause a bit of fogging on the lenses after a short while.<br /><br />Overall, decent solution to the bad padding and hygiene issue of the default facial interface, but far from the perfect or ideal solution.",4.0,firstly the important thing to know about this cover is that it simply goes over the existing padding on the rift s that means it doesnt provide extra cushioning but it does increase the surface area so id argue it is a bit more comfortable however because it just sort of sits on top it isnt very secure especially the forehead area which i find sometimes slides upwards during intense play sessions it would be nice to see an improved design that secures a bit betterbr br secondly the silicon is both a pro and a con obviously the benefit that most want from this is ease of cleaning and not absorbing sweat this definitely covers both those areas just fine however being silicon it doesnt breathe and ive found that it actually makes me sweat more than usual and while i need to play a bit more to say for certain seemed to cause a bit of fogging on the lenses after a short whilebr br overall decent solution to the bad padding and hygiene issue of the default facial interface but far from the perfect or ideal solution,1025

"Mother board went out just before warrenty expired! Thank God we acted quickly! Samsung sent a tech out within a few days (so glad we kept our old tube tv, Wii, & converter) he said this is a common problem with these TV., He had a few different parts with him as there are other issue that can arrise. So when we got the next offer from Samsung to buy the extended warrenty we did right away. (3yrs &#60; $150.00 I think). Can't imagine what a service call would cost w/o it.  Otherwise, picture can be customized as can the sound. Some people don't like the sound & buy a sound bar (expensive). Our TV is in a corner and I guess the way the room is set up it just makes for good sound. 1080 is fantastic. Sometime a little slow filling in the pix when first coming in  from amazon, hulu, netflx & acorn, (& always Ytube). but some of that may have to do with their server loads on certain days.

"This device is not so okay from the very beginning.<br />Before I get to the beginning of my review, heres a exclamation mark note:<br />if youre planning to run this on a HD Ready TV with either 720p or 1080i but the FullHD1080p, i'm telling you right now, forget it. Or you may want to buy it regardless as it will work, BUT! note that once itll start recording, this box will force the output to its recording resolution being 1080p. If your HDTV does not natively support this resolution, then be prepped for darkness, or Unsupported resolution message floating on your tv's screen in complete silence. You wont see nor hear anything thats being recorded at that moment, and will have to wait till the recording will stop or youll stop it manually so that the picture will get back on as it will be bypassed from the source 480p, 720p or 1080i. Very and I mean very annoying that this little box does not let you select resolution in options, not even one of the three quality of recording settings solve the issue, and it has nothing to do with splitter either, just letting you know this very important futuristic feature!<br />Now back to review:<br />From unboxing and getting the harddrive in, up to hooking it up, everything seemed easy and user friendly. First issue comes when you find out everything is being HDCP protected, you will need to add an HDMI splitter to bypass this ridiculous protection whether you like it or not, just get it with ordering this so you wont have to wait another few days with useless box, also, this step requires an extra HDMI cable so the price is totalling 200 already, mind you, harddrive is not in the setup yet. Once you put the USB thumb drive in, you will find out that USB2 wont record longer than about 30 seconds? Say a minute at most. Youll get a drive in, which if you want nice and hidden inside the unit, you can only use laptop drives. Dimensions of this dvr are overlapping standard desktop HDD yet, this solution wont work unless you get SATA extension cables or usb 3 enclosures for 3.5&#34; HDDs which adds even more to the budget. Anyways, once you put the drive in, it better be wiped clean meaning there are no recovery, push recovery nor any other partitions, wipe them off and create one solid partition in NTFS instead or else you'll be prompted to chkdisk on this DVR upon powering it on and hitting a record button, at the end it will render the drive useless as the fixing attempts wont reach any further than 0% for over half an hour in 512GB hdd that I first tried till I lost patience of waiting for so long to no avail until figuring out the MBR partitioning. To mention how long it took to even set the date and time by pointing the remote straight into the receiver, the reception is ridiculously BAD on this, worst in my life so far. Seriously, get an IR blaster. So all in all, instead of 170 youre spending 300 bucks or more, for sure. 230 if you have a external or any laptop HDD of acceptable capacity that suits your needs, 2TB respectively.<br />After that, it seems less hassles but still. Theres this note that recording may become interrupted, so even though checkmark proves the drive to be okay and compatible with the file system and all, theres still that 1% the box reserves to tell you that it may fail, lets hope that this wont ever happen. In 5HRs of recording, havent happened in my case, yet. I could say that this unit here comes like barebone. If nano PCs were simple GUI and direct os such as avermedia has, I would go that way, this doesnt even stream thru any cast so you need to be plugging and unplugging the drives all the time. Ethernet connection seems to be only for time sync, firmware updates and if, willingly participating in letting the unit sending errors to manuf. not even trying to see if the device would be discoverable on network to see the files on drives, highly doubt this little box would be that much sophisticated, sadly, it really feels and behaves for less than half of its real price. Lightweight, plastic, lame & simple and the IR receiver, oh the IR receiver! Maybe its the transmitter on the remote? Either way, remote is ridiculously cheap feeling too and will need new batteries after scheduling about 10 events to record, no kidding. Get an IR blaster. And if your external drive needs add'l outlet, better get 1 to 4 power outlet splitter. If all the parts mentioned need power outlet than total of 5! Aver Box, HDMI Splitter, IRblaster, TV itself, Ext USB HDD. Go figure! Unless your tv have USB port that could be used to power the IRblaster and usb powered external harddrive you'd need exactly 5 power outlets for everything.<br />Not to sound all so negative about this, the video quality is good, nothing spectacular, tinier monitors pixel pitch make it look crispier than on larger tvs but its about the same really, sound as well. Is it worth all the $? I guess, for simplicity except that of the remote issue. But like I said, I would rather choose a nano barebone PC instead, if it could be modded to be a Media Center PC with simplistic gui and a tv tuner, definitely invest all that money for components there since it will be way more useful and on network but then as a DVR compared to TiVO or tv companies supplied ones for ludicrous monthly fees, this will beat it by paying itself back in less than 2 years. TiVO is out just by thinking of it, so, yeah. I would recommend it, but because of the beginning troubles, even for experienced IT enthusiasts, 4 stars, price wise with all the things needed and a horrible remote 3 stars. Id pay 150 with 2TB drive included. Still, Im keeping it, I put too much into it, including getting a new HDTV that goes over 720p. AverMedia, wake up. Give us more options with next firmware, and dont dare to destroy the units with the firmware.<br />Oh, speaking of firmware, my unit came with the latest firmware, finding that out when I manually tried to upgrade the firmware to 1.0.11 or something like that. The firmware is from Jan, 2018 so at least I know I have one of the latest revisions of this quite poor cheap device that is better than nothing.<br />UPDATE: I have to give this box 4 stars instead of original 3 due to 1 star being deducted regarding really poor remote performance. Comes out that the IRreceiver was in visual range of my HTC Vive base stations which are known to interfere IR signals and I was not aware that they were on as I havent used them in a week however there was a power outage prior to setting AverMedia EZrecorder and forgot these basestations power on and stay on after power outages until I run the VR on the computer and then turn it off in order for them to go back into power saving mode again so its my fault and apologize for so harsh review regards the remote, but heres the thing regards the remote now and its performance, or rather AverBox performance. The remote still needs direct pointing at where the IR receiver on the box would be, sometimes it finds IR signal bouncing from surrounding glass objects but its more of an hit or miss, however even if you have done everything to best IR reception including IR blaster which still is a good periphery to have with this if you want to hide the box behind tv or anywhere out of the sight, the box itself reacts with what feels between 1 to 2 seconds lag reaction after pressing the remote buttons. Its slow reaction times makes you sometimes doubt you have pressed the button and press it again when youll realize that now, the box cycles through menus and options that you did not wish for. So I have to bear in mind to give this box a second or two after pressing the remotes buttons in order not to confuse it. Its rather annoying but actually not that bad.<br />Heres the total $ for all I needed to get this work for my purposes and why I advise for a more decent nano PC which will offer more than this box.<br />Aver Media EZrecorder 179.99<br />CKITZE BG-520 HDMI 1x2 3D splitter v1.3 HDCP 2 ports switcher 20.33<br />UGREEN HDMI Cable Right Angle with 270 Degree Elbow HDMI Cord 6.99<br />2x 1 to 3 power splitter 6.99<br />Cable Matters Infrared Remote Extender Cable 10 Feet 9.99<br />Toshiba HDWL120XZSTA L200 2TB Laptop PC Internal Hard Drive 5400 82.99<br />Mediasonic HDL-SU3 USB 3.0 3.5-inch SATA hard drive enclosure 16.99<br />WD Purple 2TB Surveillance Hard Drive - 5400 RPM Class - 79.99<br />Westinghouse 24&#34; 1080p native resolution TV - 79.99<br />$404.26 without the tv, otherwise 484.25. Price close to Steam PC; and exceeding not only Brand barebone mini, nano PCs but also many ready to go mini and nano pcs with windows license included Asus, Acer, Gigabyte or best known ZOTAC. So, yeah, make sure that the reasons for getting this particular little slow box are well justifying your needs 100% otherwise you WILL BE disappointed in all investments especially since this does support only HDD of 2TB and smaller in capacity with specially formatted drive by you yourself in its required file system in order not to render drive useless and possible of recording

that they were on as i havent used them in a week however there was a power outage prior to setting avermedia ezrecorder and forgot these basestations power on and stay on after power outages until i run the vr on the computer and then turn it off in order for them to go back into power saving mode again so its my fault and apologize for so harsh review regards the remote but heres the thing regards the remote now and its performance or rather averbox performance the remote still needs direct pointing at where the ir receiver on the box would be sometimes it finds ir signal bouncing from surrounding glass objects but its more of an hit or miss however even if you have done everything to best ir reception including ir blaster which still is a good periphery to have with this if you want to hide the box behind tv or anywhere out of the sight the box itself reacts with what feels between to seconds lag reaction after pressing the remote buttons its slow reaction times makes you sometimes doubt you have pressed the button and press it again when youll realize that now the box cycles through menus and options that you did not wish for so i have to bear in mind to give this box a second or two after pressing the remotes buttons in order not to confuse it its rather annoying but actually not that badbr heres the total for all i needed to get this work for my purposes and why i advise for a more decent nano pc which will offer more than this boxbr aver media ezrecorder br ckitze bg hdmi x d splitter v hdcp ports switcher br ugreen hdmi cable right angle with degree elbow hdmi cord br x to power splitter br cable matters infrared remote extender cable feet br toshiba hdwlxzsta l tb laptop pc internal hard drive br mediasonic hdlsu usb inch sata hard drive enclosure br wd purple tb surveillance hard drive rpm class br westinghouse p native resolution tv br without the tv otherwise price close to steam pc and exceeding not only brand barebone mini nano pcs but also many ready to go mini and nano pcs with windows license included asus acer gigabyte or best known zotac so yeah make sure that the reasons for getting this particular little slow box are well justifying your needs otherwise you will be disappointed in all investments especially since this does support only hdd of tb and smaller in capacity with specially formatted drive by you yourself in its required file system in order not to render drive useless and possible of recording failures,8623

"Held off on reviewing this until using it a few months.  Overall, it's a very good replacement cable that is well made and should be sturdy.  Like most, I tried it because it is significantly less costly than the Westone original.<br /><br />But, the &#34;industrial design&#34; is a mixed blessing.  While it should be very robust, I also notice a lot more extraneous noise as the rougher cable moves around, especially if I'm wearing a hood.  The stiffer cable doesn't conform nearly as well around my ears as the Westone version, so I have to snug up the &#34;slider&#34; to keep the cable from falling off my ears.  And, I have to be extra careful in rolling them up because the stiffer cable tends to kink or take a set more than the Westone's.<br /><br />So, I'm giving these cable 4 stars because they are a good value but not a perfect replacement for the Westone OEM cable.

"This is amazing for the price. I bought these specifically because others on Patternreview.com had bought them, and I wanted to really see the quality for myself. I was really pleased with the build on these - maybe a couple could be shinier and so on, but they are all quite like the brand name equivalents. I tested each and every one of these on my Babylock Audrey and my Brother SE400 and they all function,, As with ANY foot, you must pay attention to the stitch settings because some are made for specific tasks in which you use different stitch settings. I have not tried these on my Janome yet, but am going to and come back to edit this when I do.  This is mind bogglingly cheap for feet. I estimate easily 350+ worth of feet depending on your brand of sewing machine. There is no buttonhole, or zigzag foot included in this set.  There are a few screw on feet - of course you need a low shank machine for those, but for the snap ons you can use them on high shank or low shank machines.  There are different shanks for some machine brands - such as Janome having two shank designs. If they do not work on one shank - they may with the use of another. It depends - it's not all about low shank high shank. It's about position of the feed dogs and the needle drop. There are going to be machines that these will not work on.  But if your machine can use these - go for it - it was worth it to find out. My tests were:  needle placement and drop, feed dog placement and the ability to sew a seam with these. All worked on said machines. Some weren't perfect but could be used. I am a stickler for having the feet in the right place. :)  OK - UPDATE:  I checked these out on my Elna and Janome machines with the drop in bobbin and the 6mm stitch width. Most of these feet don't fit, in that when you get them on, they do not want to come off. That is a problem. You do not want to hurt your machine yanking them out of the foot holder.  In addition, even when on, they don't really fit the feed dog array and the needle hole is not really lined up with the opening in the machine cover plate as well as I would want.  I will not be using these on my Janome and Elna machines, but for Brother they are a really good fit. A few will fit the Janomes, but all in all, I wouldn't be able to recommend the set for Janome owners unless perhaps you have a vertical bobbin machine and they will fit your foot holder. It might be worth the try, and they can be returned if not satisfactory.  There is a lot more to use on any brand than if you have a high or low shank machine - that's for sure!!!",4.0,this is amazing for the price i bought these specifically because others on patternreviewcom had bought them and i wanted to really see the quality for myself i was really pleased with the build on these maybe a couple could be shinier and so on but they are all quite like the brand name equivalents i tested each and every one of these on my babylock audrey and my brother se and they all function as with any foot you must pay attention to the stitch settings because some are made for specific tasks in which you use different stitch settings i have not tried these on my janome yet but am going to and come back to edit this when i do this is mind bogglingly cheap for feet i estimate easily worth of feet depending on your brand of sewing machine there is no buttonhole or zigzag foot included in this set there are a few screw on feet of course you need a low shank machine for those but for the snap ons you can use them on high shank or low shank machines there are different shanks for some machine brands such as janome having two shank designs if they do not work on one shank they may with the use of another it depends its not all about low shank high shank its about position of the feed dogs and the needle drop there are going to be machines that these will not work on but if your machine can use these go for it it was worth it to find out my tests were needle placement and drop feed dog placement and the ability to sew a seam with these all worked on said machines some werent perfect but could be used i am a stickler for having the feet in the right place ok update i checked these out on my elna and janome machines with the drop in bobbin and the mm stitch width most of these feet dont fit in that when you get them on they do not want to come off that is a problem you do not want to hurt your machine yanking them out of the foot holder in addition even when on they dont really fit the feed dog array and the needle hole is not really lined up with the opening in the machine cover plate as well as i would want i will not be using these on my janome and elna machines but for brother they are a really good fit a few will fit the janomes but all in all i wouldnt be able to recommend the set for janome owners unless perhaps you have a vertical bobbin machine and they will fit your foot holder it might be worth the try and they can be returned if not satisfactory there is a lot more to use on any brand than if you have a high or low shank machine thats for sure,2496

"This is my second Forernner. I had the 210 which is great. But I wanted this new one because the screen is a touch screen. When you're running you want easy access to the data. And you get that with this watch. I just wish Garmin would have made the software syncing process exactly like the 210.<br /><br />The 610 uses a Wireless ANT, which is painful to install. The manual which guides you through this is completely wrong. It talks about what you will see and select on their web site, but their web site has obviously changed and their manual has not. So you are forced to hit Google and look for answers. Once I finally got the sync software to work with the Wireless ANT, I realized the ANT for my FitBit no longer works. Hit Google again and find everyone is having this same problem.<br /><br />Part of this is likely Windows being confused with two ANTs, one from Garmin and one from FitBit. And this exactly why Garmin and FitBit need to realize fitness nuts like me don't only have their one product. I have lots of products for fitness. I have a Garmin 800 for my Bike. I went the forerunner 210 to the 610. So it would be nice if what I already installed for 210 works for the 610, but no, that would make too much sense I guess.<br /><br />I also have Nike Plus gear. Thankfully that is all USB based and so no conflicts at all. Garmin, please just stick to USB. All you're doing is complicating things. I still have to plug in a USB ant anyway. So you accomplished nothing. I still need USB, but more complicated setup now. Since I have to use USB anyway, why not just connect the watch directly?<br /><br />So I guess I need to use the Nike Plus band and the Garmin 610 since those two devices don't conflict with each other.<br /><br />Please, STOP USING WIRELESS ANTs. They are horrible and they often just don't work well.<br /><br />Now the watch itself, GREAT!! I love the watch. I was able to set an auto lap at 1k, and when I run the watch vibrates every 1k, so I can listen to music with no interruptions and just feel the pinch of the vibration at each autolap. That's outstanding. And I configure the screen to what I want. I see pace, heart rate and distance. Perfect. Swipe my finger on the screen and see time, and swipe again and I see other data. No buttons to deal with while I run.<br /><br />This is easily the best runner's watch I have ever owned. Getting the data off it could be much better, but the watch itself is awesome!

"This is honestly a great graphics display.  The pen felt good (not as good as Wacom's, but that's the golden standard so not surprising), there was absolutely NO parallax that I could see, no issues with lag, was easy to set up, and the express keys all felt fine.  One complaint would be that the sticker on the pen case is super poorly placed.<br /> It was bubbled and warped and, based on YT unboxing videos, this seems to be a common thing.  Maybe have the text painted on the plastic instead of using a cheap, poorly-affixed sticker?  A little more weight to the pen would be nice, its pretty light compared to Wacom's.  Those are minor nitpicks, though, honestly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the drivers played havoc with my PC.

"When I selected the Philips AS140/Fidelio Docking System for the Android, I really did not have any expectations only the hope that it would be easy to set up and do what I wanted it to do....play music and maybe wake me up. I definitely did not want something too complicated or difficult to operate. And to be honest, the Philips has just the right amount of technology and features for me because there are times when I am technically challenged. Simply stated, the directions for electronics need to be easy to read and understand. And who could ask for more than easy to follow directions will illustrations (even in Spanish if you need them)? And while I probably have not untapped all of its possibilities, I think I have a decent understanding of its basic features.<br /><br />Setting up the Philips was easy enough. You simply go to the Android Market and install Songbird on your phone and PC (this allows you to download music and access it). In general, I consider the Philips Docking Station to be a super tuner (I am sure that there is a better word for it...but again, I am a girl), which allows you to access local and internet radio stations as well as podcast). You even have an option for an alarm clock and timer. When you attach your android phone (I have the LG G2x and it fits perfectly with or without the case), you can use the blue tooth feature as sort of a remote control. The phone doesn't even have to be attached to the docking station for you to surf radio stations or podcast. I was even able to access ""Pandora"" (a station that I access on my telephone) and listen to my favorite music selections.  And remember, you aren't limited to just the radio, or other programs, but you can download music (from Songbird) to your PC and access it from your phone.<br /><br />The positive things about the product:<br />(1) Easy set up. Download program, and you are in business!<br />(2) Decent sound quality.  The sound is clear. It seems a little heavy at times on the bass, but maybe that is simply because I need to play with the features a little more and learn how to address it.<br />(3) The time automatically syncs between your cell phone and the station so you don't have to really worry about it.<br />(4) Your phone charges while docked.<br />(5) The blue tooth technology allows you to use your phone as a remote...changing the stations easily.<br />(6) There is a timer and alarm feature/option.<br />(7) Downloading music is simple.<br />(8) It's cute and doesn't take up a whole lot of space on your nightstand or dresser. And if you don't want to necessarily use it as an alarm clock, you could even use it in your kitchen. It's probably better than one of those under the cabinet radios.<br /><br />Overall, I like the Philips AS140/37, it has some pretty neat features that a girl who isn't necessarily technologically savvy can enjoy.

"I'm a fan of Panasonic's electronics, and have been since I first used their GH camera line for work, and the DVX prosumer cameras before that. I was excited for a chance to replace my working headphones with ones from Panasonic, however I found it interesting that the plug type was NOT MENTIONED on this listing! The last pair of headphones + mic that I ordered came with a USB plug. It worked fine on my laptop, but not on my phone or tablet, obviously. I want a regular headphone jack, as in 1/8"" or 3.5mm (whatever  you want to call it!) to be compatible with all my things, and not rely on the limitations of bluetooth.<br />I was a little bit nervous about buying this one since it doesn't say anywhere that it is, in fact, a standard TRRS headphone-jack sized plug, but I'm happy to report that it IS! And the sound quality is what I expected from Panasonic, a good value for the price. One thing to note, however, is that this requires both sides have a wire going to the plug. This is a seriously old-school design that I almost forgot existed. Modern headphones have a single point of cable that splits to the other side in the band, however this is more like earbuds in that there's a wire going to each side.<br />It's not a deal breaker, it works fine and some people may actually prefer that look, but personally I'm worried about it being another point of contact that could get snagged/rip/break/go wrong, and actually prefer the more modern single-side cable style.

"I've been a TiVo user for nearly 8 years now. The problem with boxes like these is that they're all terrible, or at the very least they all have their own frustrating problems, so your decision is essentially which one is the least terrible, not which one is the best.<br /><br />There are many advantages to TiVo over other boxes. It's still one of the best interfaces and user experiences even though it can be annoyingly slow at times and all of the menus aren't in HD. The additions of Hulu, Netflix and other services is a big plus as well (though don't count on Amazon Instant Video to have great support here). The monthly cost isn't that bad and considering you have to pay a fee for other boxes it's not that different. The positives outweigh the fact that you can't get things like on demand from your cable company but if you're a heavy user of those services then this box is not for you.<br /><br />It isn't trouble free however. There are small annoying things like hang-ups with the UI, image dropouts during fast forwarding and the fact that sometimes you'll press a button and the TiVo will register it twice for some unknown reason. These are random though and not everyone will experience them, or at least not experience them on a regular basis. There is also a high potential for problems with associated equipment because it cannot operate alone with most cable providers if you want more than basic service. I've never had a problem with the CableCard but the tuning adapters can be incredibly frustrating. If you aren't paying attention or never watch live television and your tuning adapter needs to be reset or reauthorized you TiVo will record blank shows on many channels unnoticed until you try to watch them.<br /><br />I've also had a number of hardware failures on the years. With a box like this the hard drive essentially running at all times buffering shows. I'm on my fourth box in 8 years and the TiVo warranty is rather limited. Calling TiVo doesn't really help as they'll usually offer to send you a new power cord (which almost never is the solution) or tell you to buy another box if it's out of warranty. Thankfully these newer boxes are cheaper and thus easier to replace. Having to redo all of your settings, season passes, etc. can be frustrating though.<br /><br />As far as the service is concerned, Tivo updates the box a couple of times a year usually and each update either brings enhancements or new features. At the same time each new updates usually brings a new set of bugs for certain users.<br /><br />Still, it's a far better experience than most, if not all, standard DVRs from providers. TiVo knows this as after my most recent hardware failure I called to complain and was told I could always switch to a DVR from my cable provider. I wanted to but I knew it would be even worse so I ended up sticking with TiVo.",4.0,ive been a tivo user for nearly years now the problem with boxes like these is that theyre all terrible or at the very least they all have their own frustrating problems so your decision is essentially which one is the least terrible not which one is the bestbr br there are many advantages to tivo over other boxes its still one of the best interfaces and user experiences even though it can be annoyingly slow at times and all of the menus arent in hd the additions of hulu netflix and other services is a big plus as well though dont count on amazon instant video to have great support here the monthly cost isnt that bad and considering you have to pay a fee for other boxes its not that different the positives outweigh the fact that you cant get things like on demand from your cable company but if youre a heavy user of those services then this box is not for youbr br it isnt trouble free however there are small annoying things like hangups with the ui image dropouts during fast forwarding and the fact that sometimes youll press a button and the tivo will register it twice for some unknown reason these are random though and not everyone will experience them or at least not experience them on a regular basis there is also a high potential for problems with associated equipment because it cannot operate alone with most cable providers if you want more than basic service ive never had a problem with the cablecard but the tuning adapters can be incredibly frustrating if you arent paying attention or never watch live television and your tuning adapter needs to be reset or reauthorized you tivo will record blank shows on many channels unnoticed until you try to watch thembr br ive also had a number of hardware failures on the years with a box like this the hard drive essentially running at all times buffering shows im on my fourth box in years and the tivo warranty is rather limited calling tivo doesnt really help as theyll usually offer to send you a new power cord which almost never is the solution or tell you to buy another box if its out of warranty thankfully these newer boxes are cheaper and thus easier to replace having to redo all of your settings season passes etc can be frustrating thoughbr br as far as the service is concerned tivo updates the box a couple of times a year usually and each update either brings enhancements or new features at the same time each new updates usually brings a new set of bugs for certain usersbr br still its a far better experience than most if not all standard dvrs from providers tivo knows this as after my most recent hardware failure i called to complain and was told i could always switch to a dvr from my cable provider i wanted to but i knew it would be even worse so i ended up sticking with tivo,2777

"Lets be honest, the lock is a joke. You can open it freely when you lock it, but you are unable to close the latch if the lock is in locked mode. Thankfully, they added places for you to add your own padlock. For my use, I didn't need to locks, so I am not bummed out very much by the bad lock. The reason is that the case looks sleek and streamlined. From a distance, you would think that this is a $150 case. I use mine to store paraphernalia, so it is relatively light and I haven't had any issues with the case. The foam comes in 2 layers which is nice. I ended up only need to use 1 layer of foam (because my items had some depth to them). As a consequence, I have a &#34;back up&#34; foam if I ever want to re-setup the layout. There is alot of room in these cases, though I advise that you always leave a width of 2 squares for foam because 1 square between objects makes the foam bend out in an ugly fashion. Also, one layer of foam makes it harder to man handle when you want to adjust the foam. Though, the edges are alright to leave no extra foam because they are no perforated so won't break as easily. All in all, definitely a valuable case if you don't plan on storing heavy stuff.

"I have just recently purchased my third Dragon Touch X10 Octacore (2015 edition) tablet! I use this tablet mainly for recreational use. I am always impressed by this tablet. The lifespan of this tablet for me has been over 3 years on each. Both of the tablets ended up with a cracked screen by accident so they may have lasted a lot longer than three years had I not stepped on one, and dropped the other.<br /><br />Each time they broke, I searched far and wide for a tablet I might like better but I just can't find one with as many features and such a big display.<br /><br />Some of the things that keep me coming back are: 3 different ways to charge, the large screen display, the USB port along with the micro USB port, the octacore, the longevity and the price!<br /><br />Some of the reasons I try to find a different tablet: headphones with a mic and volume control DO NOT WORK, the speakers are WEAK, charging via micro usb takes 8 hours. Considering the price I think these cons aren't that bad. To give you an idea, a tablet of this size brand name is upwards of 900$ last time I checked, but the size is important to me.<br /><br />This last time I bought another one I noticed they had a newer version of the X10. I decided to go with this because the new version has a quad-core instead of octacore. Ive had a quad core tablet by dragon touch before, the quad core is solid with moderate use, but I promise you there is a noticeable difference. The octacore is much much smoother and I never had a problem with buffering on videos. Downloading is a flash and gameplay is seamless. I might as well go with the octacore since I'm using for mostly gaming. However, if you're using this for more social use or typing etc, I would say go with the quad core because that's more than enough for moderate use.<br /><br />It's just an all around really nice tablet. It's an off brand and sometimes people get a wonky tablet acting funny, but I've had to contact the company and they were very helpful. If there is anything wrong with your tablet I recommend exchanging it and trying again. It's worth it. Ive had a few wonky things happen with my first X10, like the screen light would go out for no apparent reason. The screen and system still worked and responded to touch but the light wasn't on. I had to use a flashlight to see the screen and try to factory reset to fix. I ended up exchanging and never had that issue again.<br /><br />I had a hard time finding a game controller compatible with this device. I even contacted the company about it. According to them they hadn't tested any controllers with the device, but theoretically any Bluetooth controller should work. Well they didn't. I went through 4 controllers until finding the right one. I tried wired, a dongle and Bluetooth. I found the Gamesir controller which is connectable 3 ways. Wired via micro usb, dongle via usb port and Bluetooth. All of these work with the tablet. Minecraft Pocket Edition is stunning on this tablet along with the Gamesir controller you are set for mining away!<br /><br />Hours of gameplay on this device. Constant. Every once in a while I can feel the tablet getting hot on the back so I'll give it a break, but that's when I'm pushing to its limits with a big game. I don't have problems with freezing while others say they do, and I've now owned 3 of them... All I can say is be VERY picky and careful about what you download on your device. Certain apps can cause freezing. Another thing that can cause that is running multiple apps while the tablet is updating apps. Always let it update without opening any apps.<br /><br />I've had no problems with adware or spyware like others had. Again be VERY careful about what you download. READ the section that tells you what permissions an app needs before downloading. If it doesn't make sense (like a flashlight app asking for contact info) don't download it. A lot of protection apps can have purposeful damaging effects. Be careful about children's games too. Just be vigilant.<br /><br />This tablet has been so reliable for me. Games and movies and videos and forums... It's a place I can wind down at the end of the day. I can download every game and app I could ever want and still have space on the device. I have never needed any extra space even with downloading movies directly on the device. I also use it to store photos via USB drive. I like it better than a computer. It's a lot faster than any computer I've used and most laptops have a quad core. There are some sites that aren't available to use with a tablet but I'm okay with that trade off.<br /><br />It's simple, I can take it everywhere, and I can use it just like I do a laptop. Connecting a keyboard and mouse is sometimes preferred when I'm typing and I can have them both working at the same time. I think I'm pretty loyal to dragon touch for good reason. It's got way more than most tablets combined and it's not so expensive that I cry if it breaks. Replacing every 3 years or so because I accidentally broke it is okay by me. You either love it or you hate it, but the vast majority of people LOVE this tablet.",4.0,i have just recently purchased my third dragon touch x octacore edition tablet i use this tablet mainly for

"Everything about this dock is either confusing, misleading, or falsely. First of all, I’m not quite sure I see the point of having two hosts connect to it as I it does not seem to be a like a KVM switch in any way. For one, video output is dedicated to one or the other host depending on the port. There is no switch to toggle between hosts so USB devices seem to be shared? Honestly it’s not at all clear. The power supply also can only charge one host, I believe whichever is plugged in first. Since there is a single ethernet jack that both hosts share it also shares a single MAC ID. The only explanation for any of this seems to be to give a buyer some impression that it behaves like a KVM switch that allows you to share peripherals. In fact it’s not even clear what it does as the instructions are incomplete. Since I was unable to get a keyboard to work connected to it I presume can you either use the built-in keyboard or plug it directly into the laptop.<br /><br />I honestly didn’t even fully unboxed this thing after reading the instructions and trying to make sense of them. Once I saw that video was not shared and that the resolution was appallingly low, all of the other issues were already moot. It is advertised as a thunderbolt 3 dock but it’s apparent that thunderbolt 3 support is quite limited and it’s really a USB-C dock. Seeing how the function of this device is very unclear a pure its existence only serves to fool customers like me into not having to use a KVM. Since the description and the instructions appear to be deliberately vague, it would seem this is the point.

"I have mixed feelings about this tablet.  First, the sound ranges from mediocre to terrible. The earphone jack is loose and has to be fix-one can only hear one side of the headphones unless one jiggles the jack.  Secondly, and more troublesome, is the repeated crashing of the tablet.  This requires a cold restart. This is never good to do to a device.  This is a KNOWN issue.<br />UPDATE: They stopped supporting any version<br />The camera is exceptional and people have asked if my pics were taken on a 35 mm or professionally.  The zoom feature is amazing; the lens does an amazing job of focusing close-ups and other difficult shots. It is versaile--from AudioBooks to music and the web. It pretty much functions like a tablet plus all the great Kindle features. The camera is better than the IPad, which I also have.  If you are going to get it, get the three year warranty. I will use it for my headphone jack. The help available through Mayday is great.  Imagine having a live person 24/7!  Their help has been fast and accurate.  There is virtually no wait time.  I usually need them when my tablet freezes--sometimes it is due to your cache being overfull. Remember to clear your dead files. This, they claim, will reduce freezes.<br /><br />TIP:<br />It is durable but a cover is essential. It is sleek. I also suggest a screen protective cover for about 10 bucks. I just saved my phone with one of these.  I caution against any cover with any magnetic closing feature. This will cause it to shut off.  It is really annoying. If the magnetic component hie screen, it shuts off.<br /><br />On a related note, I also have a seven inch, which is still going strong.  It is dummy proof and very handy. I have had it over four years....and when the battery died I found out that my 600.00 purchase could not be fixed. Come on Amazon! You can’t replace a battery?

"This Bluetooth picks up sounds from near and far away and actually amplifies them to the person on the other end, instead of cancelling those sounds out like it's supposed to. I would not recommend this Bluetooth. My boyfriend is a merchant marine officer and works long distance on a boat for a month at a time, so I like to use my Bluetooth to talk to him while he's away at work on his boat, but I can only use this Bluetooth when I'm in very quiet surroundings, otherwise he can hear every little sound amplified (even sounds that I can barely hear myself). The only thing I like about this Bluetooth is the voice command to answer a call, however I am disappointed that it does not say who is calling when it notifies you that you have an incoming call. I wish it would say &#34;Incoming call from John Doe, Answer or Ignore?&#34; But all it says is &#34;Incoming call, Answer or Ignore?&#34; Then you have to go to your phone, pick it up, and look at it, to see who is calling, which defeats the whole purpose of this feature.

"I'm going to try and ignore the fact that this thing literally damaged my person and try to be as unbiased as possible here...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- strong adhesive (also see cons)<br />- doesn't look awful? Really, I'm coming up dry, here...<br /><br />Cons:<br />- strong adhesive<br />- weak joint<br /><br />Okay, let me explain. At first, the strong adhesive was definitely a pro. I peeled off the paper to reveal the adhesive, and stuck the plate to the wall. Easy, right? So part of the test, of course, is... what happens when you need to remove it? You get something that's adhesive, and not making holes in your wall, because you want to be able to take it off! Maybe you're a renter? Maybe you want to be able to move it? This adhesive did more damage to my RENTED wall than any screw ever could. It absolutely destroyed my wall, which I now have to repair. And the adhesive was already on the plate and I couldn't peel it off, so it's not like I could replace it with another brand of adhesive or a more trusted nano tape or something. AND, now that the adhesive is now covered in paint and drywall, the whole thing is useless to even move to another place.<br /><br />Not to mention--the plate that sticks to the wall... the edges are RAZOR SHARP. Even though I used a tool to get the removal started, I didn't realize until seeing red streaks on my clothes, that the edges of the plate had bit into my fingertips and done some damage.<br /><br />The other con is that the joint between the sticking plate and the actual part that holds your phone/tablet is just a piece of rubber. It was fine holding my phone, but anything heaver than that, like my ipad, and the joint would sloooowly give and the holder would droop and eventually drop my ipad. Not something you want to have happen with an expensive piece of technology.<br /><br />This is the absolute worst thing I've gotten on Amazon in a long time.<br /><br />Does it stick to the wall? Yes.

Unfortunately, the screen cover is very loose and does not lie flat, which results in a very garbled and distorted view (see photo and video).

The listing indicates that this is an auto-focus (AF) lens. The box and the documentation that came all indicated that it was an AF lens. The actual lens itself was not an AF lens. I don't know if this was just a mistake on someones part (accidentally put the wrong lens in the box) or what. I was very disappointed. I ended up returning it and purchasing the [[ASIN:B000O161X0 Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Zoom Nikkor Lens]] for $65 more and I am very happy with it. I will say that the quality of the Sigma lens itself was very acceptable for a budget oriented lens. It fit well and operated smoothly.

"It is not a radio and clock, it is a radio or a clock. When the radio is on you see the channel, not the time.

I pretty much always want both. Every clock radio made in the last few decades has managed to do this fine but this device manages to break a solved problem. It's also uglier than it looks in the photo, and looks like a baby monitor.<br />It requires both AA and AAA batteries which is absurd and awkward and highlights how they combined 2 devices in one box, rather than making one well coordinated device.

"I had a Samsung BL103 for awhile and it was my first digital camera.  I loved it!  But when the autofocus died, I figured I'd just get a new camera than pay well over the original price to get it fixed.  I found this camera and thought it was great!  At first.  The noise of the camera focusing is very annoying.  I read that they all do this, so I just thought I would get used to it.  Wrong.  After a month and a half of daily use, it drives me nuts!

For most of my pictures I just want to take the picture, not have to go into the menu and change a bunch of stuff.  My biggest complaint would have to be the video.  At normal zoom, it was ok.

"Paying 6 bucks for this little piece of plastic is a bit much, but it did the job for me. I did find, however, that I had to make a modification for it to fit correctly. When I put on the wall plate after installing this adapter plate, I noticed that the wall plate was protruding from the wall on the side of this adapter causing a large gap to be seen. I removed the adapter plate and used a grinder to remove all of the plastic material that is built up around the screw hole that secures the wall plate.

"I am a big fan of Canon cameras, however this time I was very disappointed. I read the reviews about this camera and I thought I will get another great Canon product. But after using it for several months now, I have to say, I am very, very disappointed with this camera. This camera is a great example that smaller is not necessarily better. Yes, this camera is small and handy, it is sturdy (I dropped it onto concrete floor, not a scratch) and it has great features. HOWEVER, the quality of the pictures is bad. The flash (because of the small size of the camera) is not strong enough, so your pictures are very dark. The pictures come out only have focused, especially the outer edges of the photos are always out of focus. The overall quality is just not what I expected. I had the Powershot 500 (Ixus 500) and it was a great camera with fantastic pictures. I will go out now and buy a new camera because this one is just not worth the money. I will shoot for the G9 or something like it. Is bigger but much better quality pictures.<br />My advise, don't go by the Megapixel, more is not always better.

"I have a problem with the way ALL surge protectors are designed. Why can't they add plates with holes on each end so we can screw them into or onto cabinets, under counters, etc.? I am disabled and cannot get down onto or up off the floor. I have to keep these on table tops so I can plug in the endless chargers necessitated by modern technology. Since tech companies can't be consistent in how they shape and size transformers (I use all Apple products, and they can't be consistent within their own company), we have to be creative to get even three plugs to fit into a six-outlet adapter. Then the stupid surge protector falls on the floor, and we have to fish it out from under and behind furniture, along with transformers/plugs that have all been pulled out and then do the whole jigsaw puzzle again.

WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ATTACH THEM TO/UNDER COUNTERS SO THEY STAY WHERE WE NEED THEM. How difficult is that for these brain trusts to figure out?

"I've had this product for 2-3 years and the frustration drove me to buy a different product today. The backlight for the clock is so bright we have to cover it with a stack of books or it even keeps my husband awake- and he sleeps on the opposite side of our king bed. This interferes with the remote functioning. However, even with everything correctly positioned, as others have said, you rarely get the response you desire from the remote without several mistakes.<br /><br />Try to get the volume up and if you're not careful, it maxes easily, then goes automatically to the lowest level and vice versa. Try to get a replay and generally nothing happens for the first few presses and then it goes back too far. If you try to turn on the iPod, half the time the radio initializes instead, because the same button initializes everything, switching from one mode to the other with each press. The problem is that half the presses do nothing, so you are left cycling around, wondering what function, if any, will initialize next. AM reception is nil, so when it cycles there, loud buzzing commences,  and FM reception is poor.<br /><br />It's difficult to access the click wheel while in the dock, so you have to sit down next to the unit to do anything besides just the regular play all feature. Then when you do mess with the iPod, you are likely to dislodge it, resulting in having to attempt to program your choices more than once. Too bad you can't just select your choices, then insert into the dock, but no, not that easy.<br /><br />I found the learning curve and the annoyance of the quick rise of the alarm volume completely discouraging, so I use the alarm on my phone instead. The buttons on the unit itself must be pressed very firmly to work, and the labeling is difficult to read, so I have to sit down beside the unit and put on my reading glasses to figure out what does what. My nano is difficult to set correctly in the cradle and is easily dislodged, which has caused no end of frustration when things suddenly stop working.<br /><br />I had a couple of Memorex CD players which were poor quality and I should have learned my lesson.

"UPDATE February 2019:  The latest software update eliminated most of the problems with hijacking my hearing aids and linking with my iPhone is now more reliable.  Unfortunately, it is now virtually impossible to connect to my MacBookPro unless I do a hard reboot of both laptop and headphones.  That makes the Bose phones useless for videoconferencing, listening to music via laptop, or pretty much anything headphones are routinely used for.  It appears that the software engineering at Bose continues to be second rate, and if problems aren't fixed a year after the product was sold - I fear that they never will.  This is the last Bose product I will consider...<br /><br />UPDATE December 2018:  None of the problems from my original review have been addressed by Bose despite multiple app updates.  The implementation of Bluetooth connection on these phones is poor and unreliable; the associated app features are terrible and non-functional.  Lowered review from three to two stars now that it's clear Bose is unable or unwilling to fix the fundamental problems with these phones.<br /><br />If you rarely use Bluetooth or only connect to one device, you might be satisfied with these 'phones.  If you have no intention of using Alexa or Google Assistant, the fact that they don't work won't bother you.  Otherwise, you will be disappointed in a Bose product that doesn't work as advertised.<br /><br />Until this purchase, I've been a loyal Bose fan for decades and went out of my way to pay extra for Bose quality.  In the future, I will think very carefully before purchasing anything else from Bose...<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Wrote a glowing review immediately after buying these headphones, but this has turned out to one of the worst Bose purchases I ever made.  First the good news: the sound and hardware seem to be as excellent as the Bose reputation.  I had to switch to over-ear phones now that I wear hearing aids and decided to go all out and pay extra for the wireless features, including Alexa compatibility.<br /><br />Ten months later, it's clear that the wireless features are so flawed that they're useless with my iPhone 6.  Like many, I experience sound drop outs for no apparent reason, but the most annoying hassle is that these phones are unable to connect reliably unless you manually reinstall them almost every time.  For many months, they defaulted to my Bluetooth hearing aids no matter what so all I heard was tinny voice frequencies without any bass at all.  I emailed Bose support on all my issues but they never responded.<br /><br />I can link the phones to my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and LG TV.  BUT, unless I manually turn off all but one option, these phones never synch after the initial connection.  Alexa control is a joke because it takes too long to find the app and carry out the option.  Google Assistant isn't much better but the software is clearly biased toward Google products so be forwarned.  I gave up on both after numerous trials and just manually open the app in my iPhone and manually change playlists or whatever else I need to do.  It's much faster and more reliable to use the wired connection, which works flawlessly, but defeats the purpose of buying the wireless capabilities.<br /><br />The connection seems a bit more stable after several iOS updates this year, but sometimes these phones become less stable after an update.  Don't tell me to skip the iOS 12 update: updates make my data more stable and my Apple devices more responsive.  Bose shouldn't advertise a product that's not functional with modern OS.<br /><br />Based on my experience and the lackluster Bose support, think twice before paying more for the Bluetooth versions of these phones.",2.0,update february the latest software update eliminated most of the problems with hijacking my hearing aids and linking with my iphone is now more reliable unfortunately it is now virtually impossible to connect to my macbookpro unless i do a hard reboot of both laptop and headphones that makes the bose phones useless for videoconferencing listening to music via laptop or pretty much anything headphones are routinely used for it appears that the software engineering at bose continues to be second rate and if problems arent fixed a year after the product was sold i fear that they never will this is the last bose product i will considerbr br update december none of the problems from my original review have been addressed by bose despite multiple app updates the implementation of bluetooth connection on these phones is poor and unreliable the associated app features are terrible and nonfunctional lowered review from three to two stars now that its clear bose is unable or unwilling to fix the fundamental problems with these phonesbr br if you rarely use bluetooth or only connect to one device you might be satisfied with these phones if you have no intention of using alexa or google assistant the fact that they dont work wont bother you otherwise you will be disappointed in a bose product that doesnt work as advertisedbr br until this purchase ive been a loyal bose fan for decades and went out of my way to pay extra for bose quality in the future i will think very carefully before purchasing anything else from bosebr br original reviewbr wrote a glowing review immediately after buying these headphones but this has turned out to one of the worst bose purchases i ever made first the good news the sound and hardware seem to be as excellent as the bose reputation i had to switch to overear phones now that i wear hearing aids and decided to go all out and pay extra for the wireless features including alexa compatibilitybr br ten months later its clear that the wireless features are so flawed that theyre useless with my iphone like many i experience sound drop outs for no apparent reason but the most annoying hassle is that these phones are unable to connect reliably unless you manually reinstall them almost every time for many months they defaulted to my bluetooth hearing aids no matter what so all i heard was tinny voice frequencies without any bass at all i emailed bose support on all my issues but they never respondedbr br i can link the phones to my iphone ipad macbook pro and lg tv but unless i manually turn off all but one option these phones never synch after the initial connection alexa control is a joke because it takes too long to find the app and carry out the option google assistant isnt much better but the software is clearly biased toward google products so be forwarned i gave up on both after numerous trials and just manually open the app in my iphone and manually change playlists or whatever else i need to do its much faster and more reliable to use the wired connection which works flawlessly but defeats the purpose of buying the wireless capabilitiesbr br the connection seems a bit more stable after several ios updates this year but sometimes these phones become less stable after an update dont tell me to skip the ios update updates make my data more stable and my apple devices more responsive bose shouldnt advertise a product thats not functional with modern osbr br based on my experience and the lackluster bose support think twice before paying more for the bluetooth versions of these phones,3563

"We bought one of these for video to use our existing Lowel Totas. Idea was to be able to transport and erect a large softlight on location. I love the stand adapter.

"Bought this camera for my 7 year old.  As a toy, it isn't bad.  However, if I were buying this for myself I would have been less than unsatisfied with this for the price.<br /><br />This camera is at best worth about $15.  NOT $70!<br /><br />It has no actual zoom.  Digital zoom only.  Which means less quality to the photo.<br /><br />It has no memory.  You cannot take and store a single photo on the camera.  You must purchase an SD card before you can use the camera.  SD card is NOT included.  (This isn't meant to be a good or bad review.  It is what it is.  The manufacturer can choose to include or not.  Just pointing this out so you are not caught off-guard when you receive it)<br /><br />There are some nice features to the camera but overall the camera is a very cheap and flimsy-feeling device.  Buttons and other controls feel like they could break easily.  This is the standard by which most ""Chinese products"" are made.<br /><br />I haven't tested the camera underwater yet.  That is one of the reasons I purchased this model for my child as a gift.  We like snorkeling and I hope this will work for that purpose.  So I will have to test this when we get the chance.<br /><br />As long as the camera performs under water like it is rated for, I think we will be ok with it for the purpose we purchased it for.  However, at this price, I would have expected a lot more quality in this camera.<br /><br />If you are looking to get what you pay for.... this isn't the camera to purchase.

"What I thought was going to be the perfect solution to run a firewire audio interface, a hard drive hub via eSATA, and a 4k monitor turned out be a frustrating experience.  It seems all of the problems originate when the computer goes to sleep and wakes back up.  Upon awaking, nothing works properly.  The 4k monitors lose all of their settings, i.e. scaling, arrangement, and wallpaper.  Also after awaking, the firewire and eSATA ports are no longer read / identified by the computer.<br /><br />To solve all of this, unplugging and replugging the power to the Akitio Thunder2 Dock seems to reset everything and the computer will again read the firewire and eSATA ports–however, the monitors need to be reconfigured each time.  None of this happens when I plug these devices in individually without the Dock, the computer sleeping and waking without issue.<br /><br />In short, this device will work as promised on initial power up.  Once the computer wakes after sleep, all of the issues arise. Because of this, you can't plug all of your devices into the Dock and just forget about it.  I will only be using the Thunder2 Dock when I specifically need certain ports, the rest of the time it is a paper weight.<br /><br />MacBook Pro 15"" 2.8GHz i7 Mid 2014 - Mojave 10.1.4<br />2 - ViewSonic 4k VX3211 Monitors<br />MOTU Traveler Firewire Audio Interface<br />ThermalTake Dual Bay eSATA Storage",2.0,what i thought was going to be the perfect solution to run a firewire audio interface a hard drive hub via esata and a k monitor turned out be a frustrating experience it seems all of the problems originate when the computer goes to sleep and wakes back up upon awaking nothing works properly the k monitors lose all of their settings ie scaling arrangement and wallpaper also after awaking the firewire and esata ports are no longer read identified by the computerbr br to solve all of this unplugging and replugging the power to the akitio thunder dock seems to reset everything and the computer will again read the firewire and esata portshowever the monitors need to be reconfigured each time none of this happens when i plug these devices in individually without the dock the computer sleeping and waking without issuebr br in short this device will work as promised on initial power up once the computer wakes after sleep all of the issues arise because of this you cant plug all of your devices into the dock and just forget about it i will only be using the thunder dock when i specifically need certain ports the rest of the time it is a paper weightbr br macbook pro ghz i mid mojave br viewsonic k vx monitorsbr motu traveler firewire audio interfacebr thermaltake dual bay esata storage,1298

"I live in hopes of finding bluetooth headphones to wear with my phone while walking my dogs or exercising so that I can listen to recorded books.

In other words it went back a few seconds in the recording.

"This is a nice little drone but Parrot updated their FreeFlight 3 app, now called FreeFlight Mini, and the camera button/ option is nowhere to be found on the new app for the Rolling Spider so the camera is no longer functional.

After I emailed them the product description from Parrot.com, Amazon.com, as well as a photo of the side of the box where it indicates that it does have a camera, they told me the camera button is on the upper right side of the control screen of the FreeFlight Mini app.  Literally went in a complete circle with them as the reason why I contacted them in the first place is because there is no camera button on the app, upper right side or anywhere else.

"Winegard has made some great TV antennas over the years. This is not one of them. With Radio Shack out of business Winegard and Channel Master seem to be one of the few old-school brand names still making TV antennas these days. The company has traditional manufactured both residential and commercial grade antennas that were built not only to last but to perform good enough to provide a broadcast quality picture. Their latest offering the Winegard ""Elite"" is quite a disappointment by comparison.<br /><br />The company seems to be taking advantage of the recent rush by consumers to ""upgrade"" their big, ugly outdoor antennas in favor of smaller, more compact ""cuter"" looking antennas. Let me make one thing perfectly clear... A larger, better constructed antenna will ALWAYS provide a better signal than a smaller one, regardless of price. If you have one of those huge eyesore antennas from Radio Shack that was installed in the 1970's hold on to it. There is no need to ""upgrade"". Those antennas work just as well for HD signals as newer models and will pull in far more stations than an antenna like this will.<br /><br />There is no such thing as an ""HD antenna"". Antennas do not know the difference between digital and analog. There is also no such thing as 4K TV, at least not here in the United States. Buying a newer antenna is not going to get you ANY 4K UHD programming because TV stations do not transmit in 4K. Period. I have no idea why Wingard is trying to pass off UHD reception as something that is possible.<br /><br />To say that the construction of this device is not up to Winegard's normal standards is a vast understatement. It's build quality is horrible. It's overwhelmingly made of cheap, plastic parts and antenna elements that are far too small to provide decent reception on the VHF band. I happen to live in an area where we still have a VHF Channel 3, and the reception on this is horrible, even with the built-in pre-amp.<br /><br />Why would anyone pay over $100 for such a cheap device that looks like a million other brands made in China? I have no clue. It's definitely not a good value proposition, nor is it any better built than it's cheaper Chinese counterparts. I suspect that the pre-amp likely performs much better than competitors and introduces far less noise. That is really no justification for buying this vs a larger outdoor antenna that is built better though.<br /><br />If you are looking for the best reception possible and an antenna that is still going to be in one piece five years from now I would highly recommend one of Winegard's Platinum Series antennas. You can always add a pre-amp later on if the signal you get needs to be boosted more, but you are far better off starting with a high quality, commercial quality antenna that is located as high up as possible. Their Platinum Series antennas may not look ""cute"", but you will be a lot happier with the product in the long run.",2.0,winegard has made some great tv antennas over the years this is not one of them with radio shack out of business winegard and channel master seem to be one of the few oldschool brand names still making tv antennas these days the company has traditional manufactured both residential and commercial grade antennas that were built not only to last but to perform good enough to provide a broadcast quality picture their latest offering the winegard elite is quite a disappointment by comparisonbr br the company seems to be taking advantage of the recent rush by consumers to upgrade their big ugly outdoor antennas in favor of smaller more compact cuter looking antennas let me make one thing perfectly clear a larger better constructed antenna will always provide a better signal than a smaller one regardless of price if you have one of those huge eyesore antennas from radio shack that was installed in the s hold on to it there is no need to upgrade those antennas work just as well for hd signals as newer models and will pull in far more stations than an antenna like this willbr br there is no such thing as an hd antenna antennas do not know the difference between digital and analog there is also no such thing as k tv at least not here in the united states buying a newer antenna is not going to get you any k uhd programming because tv stations do not transmit in k period i have no idea why wingard is trying to pass off uhd reception as something that is possiblebr br to say that the construction of this device is not up to winegards normal standards is a vast understatement its build quality is horrible its overwhelmingly made of cheap plastic parts and antenna elements that are far too small to provide decent reception on the vhf band i happen to live in an area where we still have a vhf channel and the reception on this is horrible even with the builtin preampbr br why would anyone pay over for such a cheap device that looks like a million other brands made in china i have no clue its definitely not a good value proposition nor is it any better built than its cheaper chinese counterparts i suspect that the preamp likely performs much better than competitors and introduces far less noise that is really no justification for buying this vs a larger outdoor antenna that is built better thoughbr br if you are looking for the best reception possible and an antenna that is still going to be in one piece five years from now i would highly recommend one of winegards platinum series antennas you can always add a preamp later on if the signal you get needs to be boosted more but you are far better off starting with a high quality commercial quality antenna that is located as high up as possible their platinum series antennas may not look cute but you will be a lot happier with the product in the long run,2835

"Update: Battery life is TERRIBLE!  Lasted &lt; 1 month before needing to be charged. I’ve decreased the sensitivity several times (still pick up cars going by) and still only getting about one month before having to recharge. One HUGE issue that I’ve noticed is you can not customize your notifications of motion/doorbell with your Echo devices in that you either get notifications to all of your devices or none of them. My son moved into a dorm this year and took his Echo dot with him but left it tied to my Amazon account. I had to turn off all the notifications because he kept getting them at his dorm so now I don’t even get notified if someone e is at my door! I know this is a pretty unique situation but could also apply to you for instance if you have an Echo in a baby’s room. You are not going to want it announced on that Echo whenever there is motion at your door or for a doorbell. They need to make it to where you can choose which devices announce these things. Because of this (which I think is a pretty major issue for our family) and the sucky battery life, I am downgrading my rating of this from 3 to 2 stars.<br /><br />Had LOTS of trouble getting it to work properly. Wouldn’t send me ANY notifications of motion detection for over a week! Went back and forth getting tech support via email (also a big pain!). Finally started sending notifications but then was missing motion detection most of the time! Not sure what finally got it to work, but it’s working now. I get WAY too many notifications of cars driving by though and I’ve lowered the sensitivity multiple times. I feel like if I lower it much more, it’s not going to pick people up until they are on my doorstep. I’m relatively happy with it now, but overall I’m somewhat disappointed. I would recommend it, I mean now that it finally is working, I like being able to see who comes to my door, when packages are delivered, etc. But only 3 stars due to the major hassle it was took to get it to this point.",2.0,update battery life is terrible lasted lt month before needing to be charged ive decreased the sensitivity several times still pick up cars going by and still only getting about one month before having to recharge one huge issue that ive noticed is you can not customize your notifications of motiondoorbell with your echo devices in that you either get notifications to all of your devices or none of them my son moved into a dorm this year and took his echo dot with him but left it tied to my amazon account i had to turn off all the notifications because he kept getting them at his dorm so now i dont even get notified if someone e is at my door i know this is a pretty unique situation but could also apply to you for instance if you have an echo in a babys room you are not going to want it announced on that echo whenever there is motion at your door or for a doorbell they need to make it to where you can choose which devices announce these things because of this which i think is a pretty major issue for our family and the sucky battery life i am downgrading my rating of this from to starsbr br had lots of trouble getting it to work properly wouldnt send me any notifications of motion detection for over a week went back and forth getting tech support via email also a big pain finally started sending notifications but then was missing motion detection most of the time not sure what finally got it to work but its working now i get way too many notifications of cars driving by though and ive lowered the sensitivity multiple times i feel like if i lower it much more its not going to pick people up until they are on my doorstep im relatively happy with it now but overall im somewhat disappointed i would recommend it i mean now that it finally is working i like being able to see who comes to my door when packages are delivered etc but only stars due to the major hassle it was took to get it to this point,1927

"I bought one of these tablets at Best Buy, really excited to try it out and was never thoroughly excited to actually use it.

"I liked the look of these and the case, though I never got a chance to see how long the battery did last. In two days, the case was still four dots (fully charged) so that's good! The sound was decent along with noise cancellation, though I wouldn't say top of the line, it was in alignment with the cost.<br /><br />Now, the biggest issue with these which leaves them useless is the cutting in and out. I ensured these were fully charged and in the upright position per the instructions. However, when I work out or even twist them a little in my ear (since they can loosen in my ear with activity), it cuts in and out as if a poor connection (though my phone is 1 ft away from me). Then there would be no sound and I would have to tweak for a good 30 seconds to get it to have full sound again, this happened with both earbuds.

"Just a quick note: The Lepai amp is not a particularly good match for these speakers. These speakers can be bright, and the Lepai is a somewhat thin and grainy amp.<br /><br />============================================<br />Packaging Construction and Look<br /><br />(my first set came with bad woofer, and I knocked a star off for that)<br /><br />They were packed really well. There was a shipping box and then a box in a box to hold the speakers, for 3 boxes total. The speakers are held in nice thick foam with plenty of space between the speakers and the sides of the box. The speakers are wrapped in cloth bags and under the cloth bag is some thin padding. Not sure what use the bags are, except to make them seem like more expensive speakers than they are. To my mind this are over-packed, but better safe than sorry I guess.<br /><br />At first the appearance seems kind of classy. But after looking at them they start to look kind of plain, make that very plain. I'm ok with the satin/matte, but in the absence of any other kind of styling, not even a logo somewhere, it starts to look like they were sprayed with primer but didn't make it to paint.<br /><br />They have a fairly nice rubber mat on the bottom and inserts for stand or wall mounting and the quality of the finish is good and they don't look or feel cheap.<br /><br />I opened up the P4 and looked around, the woofer is a speaker with a Ferrite magnet. While it doesn't really matter to the sound, a Neodymium magnet would be indicative of a more expensive speaker. The specs on the P4 claim 3/4"" MDF, but I was able to measure the back and it not even 1/2"" thick. What they call ""heavily braced"" is actually MDF laminated together to get the thickness needed to mount the speakers and I'm assuming where the lamination is equals 3/4"". I could not evaluate the thickness of the sides, But if I had to guess from tapping/knocking on them I'd say it's the same thinner material. The speaker connectors are good quality taking bare wire or a banana jack, and are angled in such a way that the speaker can be put very close to a wall.<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Background<br /><br />These are the 3rd set of speakers I've auditioned in 3 weeks in the $150 to $250 price range in the same computer based system. Amplification was the Topping TP30 (which I recommend very highly)<br /><br />Sound source was mostly ogg/Mp3 music rips between 192kbs - 320kbs of my CD's and some, but not a lot of FLAC. Casual listening was mostly a 300 song playlist on grooveshark of songs recommended by people for speaker auditioning. Other listening was 320kbs streams from Spotify and 192kbs streams from Pandora.<br /><br />All listening was from computer desk distances in a small 10x12 room.<br /><br />In a past life I made my living for 5+ years dong live sound/stage work and some studio mix down work. I play acoustic guitar for my own enjoyment, and work on electric guitars as a hobby and for friends. I have been using some of my speaker test songs for 20+ years and listening to some of them for 30+.<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Updated 2/16/2014 after ~2 weeks of listening<br /><br />Sound review<br /><br />Note: People who really want to understand these speakers, and their problems, should read the review at noaudiophile.<br /><br />I can see why people like these speakers, but I can't like them enough to keep them.<br /><br />There is something going on in the midrange on the P4s that is not right. Male vocals hit a certain frequency and it loses something. It loses some of the 'chest' sound. Female vocals can start to sound harsh. Certain notes on an acoustic piano take on a artificial 'plinky' sound. Snare drums have too much 'crack' and not enough 'pop' if that makes sense. Guitar strings can be a bit jangly.<br /><br />This all matches up to the review at noaudiophile.<br /><br />This doesn't mean they sound horrible, it just means they don't sound right all the time. They  do bass well. It's punchy and you start rocking out in your seat and it's well controlled and defined. (I have listened to them with and without a sub)<br /><br />Depending on the music/instrumentation they can have a very pleasing sound, if at times a touch bright, but sibilance is always under control.<br /><br />After 2 weeks I have noticed a disconnect between the Woofer and Tweeter. This also matches the review at noaudiophile (which has graphs to show the hole in the frequency response)<br /><br />This bothers me, because this speakers are expensive for what they are, there shouldn't be a 'hole' in the frequency response causing the problems above.<br /><br />They are forgiving of placement, including height. Mine ended up next to my 24"" monitor with the top of the speakers about eye level and the speakers pointing straight ahead. Stereo imaging is only Ok and the do not have a strong center image, which is part of the reason my speakers ended up being placed near my monitor. This would probably improve if I toed them in, but having them pointed straight sounded better to me.<br /><br />=============================<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />In spite of the above:<br /><br />Most people will like how these speakers sound, even picky me could get used to them (well except for the disconnect between the woofer and tweeter, that still bugs me).<br /><br />But the value isn't there for me, not with a big hole in the frequency response. Steven Guttenberg can gush over these all he wants but the hole in the frequency response is there and the review at noaudiphile shows it's there. How much or how little this bothers you depends on you, how well you know your music, what other sound systems you listen on, etc.<br /><br />With the Topping Amp (the best value in an amp with a DAC) you are now in budget of $335 dollars.<br /><br />For out and out sound, I'd give them 4 stars, but that is out of respect to the good reviews that are out there for these speakers. I took star off for the bad speaker out of the box (there is no excuse for that given what these cost vs cost to make), and took 1 star off for the lack of value for the price.<br /><br />========================================<br /><br />Final thoughts<br /><br />I think the Behringer MS40 a similar size speaker is worth a hard look (the MS40 is one of the speakers I auditioned in the last month). For $100 less you get an amp, a DAC, two inputs, one digital, independent volume control of the two sources, tone controls on the front and a headphone jack.<br /><br />Unlike the P4 the Behringer the MS40 is a great deal for the money. Based on the sound, I'd have to give it to the P4s for being slightly more musical sounding, while the MS40 has a more 'studio monitor' sound but can be a bit muddy, in an area where the P4 sounds very good.<br /><br />In the same size class, while I haven't heard them but  based on reviews, I'd also give the M-Audio AV 40 some serious consideration.<br /><br />The Behringer and M-Audio show it is not that expensive to put 4 speakers in a box and have it sound good. And Behringer and M-Audio manage to get you an amp in the deal, and for a lot less money.<br /><br />Another example of what  'what-you-get' for your money, and another option, take a look (not on Amazon) is the Swan M50W. For $50 more than the P4, (less if you consider the cost of the Topping amp), you get an active 2.1 system with a seriously  attractive finish and a very sexy volume puck from a Manufacture of some very high-end speaker systems.",2.0,just a quick note the lepai amp is not a particularly good match for these speakers these speakers can be bright and the lepai is a somewhat thin and grainy ampbr br br packaging construction and lookbr br my first set came with bad woofer and i knocked a star off for thatbr br they were packed really well there was a shipping box and then a box in a box to hold the speakers for boxes total the speakers are held in nice thick foam with plenty of space between the speakers and the sides of the box the speakers are wrapped in cloth bags and under the cloth bag is some thin padding not sure what use the bags are except to make them seem like more expensive speakers than they are to my mind this are overpacked but better safe than sorry i guessbr br at first the appearance seems kind of classy but after looking at them they start to look kind of plain make that very plain im ok with the satinmatte but in the absence of any other kind of styling not even a logo somewhere it starts to look like they were sprayed with primer but didnt make it to paintbr br they have a fairly nice rubber mat on the bottom and inserts for stand or wall mounting and the quality of the finish is good and they dont look or feel cheapbr br i opened up the p and looked around the woofer is a speaker with a ferrite magnet while it doesnt really matter to the sound a neodymium magnet would be indicative of a more expensive speaker the specs on the p claim mdf but i was able to measure the back and it not even thick what they call heavily braced is actually mdf laminated together to get the thickness needed to mount the speakers and im assuming where the lamination is equals i could not evaluate the thickness of the sides but if i had to guess from tappingknocking on them id say its the same thinner material the speaker connectors are good quality taking bare wire or a banana jack and are angled in such a way that the speaker can be put very close to a wallbr br br br backgroundbr br these are the rd set of speakers ive auditioned in weeks in the to price range in the same computer based system amplification was the topping tp which i recommend very highlybr br sound source was mostly oggmp music rips between kbs kbs of my cds and some but not a lot of flac casual listening was mostly a song playlist on grooveshark of songs recommended by people for speaker auditioning other listening was kbs streams from spotify and kbs streams from pandorabr br all listening was from computer desk distances in a small x roombr br in a past life i made my living for years dong live soundstage work and some studio mix down work i play acoustic guitar for my own enjoyment and work on electric guitars as a hobby and for friends i have been using some of my speaker test songs for years and listening to some of them for br br br br updated after weeks of listeningbr br sound reviewbr br note people who really want to understand these speakers and their problems should read the review at noaudiophilebr br i can see why people like these speakers but i cant like them enough to keep thembr br there is something going on in the midrange on the ps that is not right male vocals hit a certain frequency and it loses something it loses some of the chest sound female vocals can start to sound harsh certain notes on an acoustic piano take on a artificial plinky sound snare drums have too much crack and not enough pop if that makes sense guitar strings can be a bit janglybr br this all matches up to the review at noaudiophilebr br this doesnt mean they sound horrible it just means they dont sound right all the time they do bass well its punchy and you start rocking out in your seat and its well controlled and defined i have listened to them with and without a subbr br depending on the musicinstrumentation they can have a very pleasing sound if at times a touch bright but sibilance is always under controlbr br after weeks i have noticed a disconnect between the woofer and tweeter this also matches the review at noaudiophile which has graphs to show the hole in the frequency responsebr br this bothers me because this speakers are expensive for what they are there shouldnt be a hole in the frequency response causing the problems abovebr br they are forgiving of placement including height mine ended up next to my monitor with the top of the speakers about eye level and the speakers pointing straight ahead stereo imaging is only ok and the do not have a strong center image which is part of the reason my speakers ended up being placed near my monitor this would probably improve if i toed them in but having them pointed straight sounded better to mebr br br br conclusionbr br in spite of the abovebr br most people will like how these speakers sound even picky me could get used to them well except for the disconnect between the woofer and tweeter that still bugs mebr br but the value isnt there for me not with a big hole in the frequency response steven guttenberg can gush over these all he wants but the hole in the frequency response is there and the review at noaudiphile shows its there how much or how little this bothers you depends on you how well you know your music what other sound systems you listen on etcbr br with the topping amp the best value in an amp with a dac you are now in budget of dollarsbr br for out and out sound id give them stars but that is out of respect to the good reviews that are out there for these speakers i took star off for the bad speaker out of the box there is no excuse for that given what these cost vs cost to make and took star off for the lack of value for the pricebr br br br final thoughtsbr br i think the behringer ms a similar size speaker is worth a hard look the ms is one of the speakers i auditioned in the last month for less you get an amp a dac two inputs one digital independent volume control of the two sources tone controls on the front and a headphone jackbr br unlike the p the behringer the ms is a great deal for the money based on the sound id have to give it to the ps for being slightly more musical sounding while the ms has a more studio monitor sound but can be a bit muddy in an area where the p sounds very goodbr br in the same size class while i havent heard them but based on reviews id also give the maudio av some serious considerationbr br the behringer and maudio show it is not that expensive to put speakers in a box and have it sound good and behringer and maudio manage to get you an amp in the deal and for a lot less moneybr br another example of what whatyouget for your money and another option take a look not on amazon is the swan mw for more than the p less if you consider the cost of the topping amp you get an active system with a seriously attractive finish and a very sexy volume puck from a manufacture of some very highend speaker systems,6860

"This is a frustrating product because it's so close to being great.<br /><br />The good:<br />- nice battery life<br />- controls are good and responsive<br />- the auto-on when inserted into your ear works very well<br />- I think I have weirdly shaped ear canals as it's about a 50/50 chance whether they tend to slip out. For silicone tips, that goes up to like an 80% chance of a poor fit. These lock in and don't move at all. That's great!<br /><br />All of that is offset by the terrible audio quality.

Standing about 4' from the camera you can barely identify a face. Any farther away than that and a face is just a pixelated mess in broad daylight.

"I am located about 30 miles to the southeast of Atlanta, Ga. I was using an RCA amplified rabbit ears to view local channels. I read the reviews on the MLU amplified indoor antenna and thought that it might perform better than my rabbit ears. So I ordered it and tried it on two of the TVs in my home. One TV is in my basement and the other one is in my living room. Over the course of a month and a half I moved the antenna all over and I was not able to out perform the rabbit ears. I was very disappointed because I was hoping to cancel my satelite service and use the MLU product to view the local channels. I would also have probably subscribed to Netflix or one of other content providers. I decided to return the product and found that the return window time period had expired. That was my fault because I kept working the antennae over time trying to find a location that would give good reception. I am 60 something years old and it takes me some time to move the product around by myself. I am sure it works for some folks from the reviews I read. It may work for you also but if it doesn't send it back within the time allowed.

"I really tried to give this unit a fair shake and wanted to like it, but I really can't recommend this given the issues I've had.<br /><br />I have two PCs, one with dual 2K screens and the other with a single 1080 screen.  On the first PC I have the second 2K monitor connected to this KVM.  So, I'm switching between the second 2K screen on PC1 and the 1080 screen on PC2<br /><br />First, the pros:<br /><br />This is a nice, compact unit.  It has a switching button on a detachable cord so the KVM can be placed out of the way and just the single cord with switch can extend out.  There is no switch on the unit itself.<br /><br />The integrated HDMI/USB PC cables work fine and are reasonably long enough (about 4 feet).<br /><br />There are bright blue indicator lights on the top of the unit to show which PC is currently connected.  If you want to see what PC is connected, however, the KVM still needs to be in view.  There is no indicator on the remote switch.<br /><br />My wireless keyboard/mouse use a single shared dongle, and I was pleasantly surprised to find when I plugged it into the mouse port both keyboard and mouse functioned fine.  This was not the case if I plugged it into the keyboard port.<br /><br />Now the cons:<br /><br />I fiddled with it for a while trying to get it to show the 2nd PC's 1080 display.  It would just remain black.  I connected the monitor directly to the PC with a good HDMI cable and it worked fine so that wasn't it.  I then tried with a DP to HDMI adapter.  Still no luck.  I was about to put it back in the box when I looked more closely at the small print in the manual and saw that you have to hold down the switcher button for 5 seconds to basically initialize the connection to a newly added display.  Voila!  Never had to do that with a KVM before nor should you have to do this for a proper functioning KVM.<br /><br />The active display occasionally goes dark for no obvious reason and I have to perform another ""sync"" by holding down the remote button for 5 seconds.  I'm just not able to realistically use this if I have to re-sync regularly.<br /><br />When I switch between PCs I hear the Windows USB connect/disconnect sound.  I'm thinking it's disconnecting the USB keyboard/mouse rather than keeping them alive when you switch.  Or maybe it's the monitor disconnecting, I can't be sure.  Either way, the KVM doesn't seem to be maintaining a device connection when you switch which shouldn't happen.<br /><br />I get that the mouse and keyboard input ports should be on the front.  But the HDMI output really should be on the back otherwise cable management becomes a bit more painful.<br /><br />There is no audio switching which I knew up front so not really a con, per se.  I could live with that but it would be nice to have.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'm honestly not too enthused about this KVM and can't really recommend it.  Others may have more luck, but in my personal setup it just doesn't meet my expectations.",2.0,i really tried to give this unit a fair shake and wanted to like it but i really cant recommend this given the issues ive hadbr br i have two pcs one with dual k screens and the other with a single screen on the first pc i have the second k monitor connected to this kvm so im switching between the second k screen on pc and the screen on pcbr br first the prosbr br this is a nice compact unit it has a switching button on a detachable cord so the kvm can be placed out of the way and just the single cord with switch can extend out there is no switch on the unit itselfbr br the integrated hdmiusb pc cables work fine and are reasonably long enough about feetbr br there are bright blue indicator lights on the top of the unit to show which pc is currently connected if you want to see what pc is connected however the kvm still needs to be in view there is no indicator on the remote switchbr br my wireless keyboardmouse use a single shared dongle and i was pleasantly surprised to find when i plugged it into the mouse port both keyboard and mouse functioned fine this was not the case if i plugged it into the keyboard portbr br now the consbr br i fiddled with it for a while trying to get it to show the nd pcs display it would just remain black i connected the monitor directly to the pc with a good hdmi cable and it worked fine so that wasnt it i then tried with a dp to hdmi adapter still no luck i was about to put it back in the box when i looked more closely at the small print in the manual and saw that you have to hold down the switcher button for seconds to basically initialize the connection to a newly added display voila never had to do that with a kvm before nor should you have to do this for a proper functioning kvmbr br the active display occasionally goes dark for no obvious reason and i have to perform another sync by holding down the remote button for seconds im just not able to realistically use this if i have to resync regularlybr br when i switch between pcs i hear the windows usb connectdisconnect sound im thinking its disconnecting the usb keyboardmouse rather than keeping them alive when you switch or maybe its the monitor disconnecting i cant be sure either way the kvm doesnt seem to be maintaining a device connection when you switch which shouldnt happenbr br i get that the mouse and keyboard input ports should be on the front but the hdmi output really should be on the back otherwise cable management becomes a bit more painfulbr br there is no audio switching which i knew up front so not really a con per se i could live with that but it would be nice to havebr br bottom line im honestly not too enthused about this kvm and cant really recommend it others may have more luck but in my personal setup it just doesnt meet my expectations,2791

"I like the camera’s EXCEPT:<br />1) When you disarm the camera, the camera still records motion unless you manually turn off two motion settings for each camera (based on your sensitivity setting, a video records every time there is movement = numerous daily videos to deal with).  Then, you have to remember to manually turn them on again when you want to record and detect motion.  ADD MORE OPTIONS WHEN DISARMING CAMERAS.<br />2) The camera never turns off even when you have set a schedule to disarm the units.  ALLOW CAMERA TO BE TURNED OFF… If you don’t want to be viewed by other members of your household with Blink access, you have to physically cover each camera to block the viewing feature.  Guests do NOT want to be on camera when visiting your home.  AND, I don’t want my spouse calling me to give me advice based on what he sees me doing at the time.  PLEASE provide an option to turn off all motion recordings and viewing ability when the unit is disarmed.  I am hesitant to set-up the cameras in the house because they will always be running when I am home.

"The unit I received had 11 permanent blue blotches on the screen regardless of input or picture adjustment.<br />When that was replaced, I then experienced an excessive amount of back-light bleeding in the lower-right corner. Some back-light bleeding is understandable, but in order to eliminate this problem I had to set both the Backlight and Brightness settings to zero, which produced a terrible picture for daytime viewing. I am still awaiting correction from Samsung on the latter issue.<br />Samsung Tech Support is repetitive, time-consuming, and lengthy.I spent over an hour on the phone with them only to be told that I needed to call back, again, the next day. I had already been on the phone for 40 minutes in spite of the fact that I was told, on the previous call, that I would be immediately &#34;escalated&#34; to the next tier. This was not true.<br />The service company that was assigned to service my TV was VERY late for every appointment, did not communicate that they would be late, and kept trying to avoid service by asking &#34;Does 'really' affect anything?&#34; To which my response was, &#34;YES!!! It freakin' affects things. I paid almost $1,000 for this TV, and I want it to perform as expected! Is that not what I paid for!?&#34;<br />Additionally, the service sub-contractors replaced a malfunctioning component, but did so with a damaged bezel..<br />When confronted about the problem, they again asked, &#34;Well... does it really affect anything?&#34;<br />What the hell kind of question is that!?<br />If you buy a new BMW, and take it in to be serviced, and they fix the transmission but damage the bumper in the process, would you NOT expect them to replace/fix the bumper!?!?<br /><br />I'm still dealing with Samsung in regards to getting this damned thing to function within expected tolerances.<br /><br />It does provide a really nice picture - overlooking the image problems, in general - and it is awesome as a PC monitor (assuming it worked properly).<br />The picture options allow for millions of image settings, allowing you to adjust to your preferences. I had to spend a lot of time adjusting mine, but after a little searching the internet, I found a reliable guide for adjusting the quality in a comprehensive manner.<br /><br />The &#34;smart&#34; functions (such as Netflix) and tech support options are adequate but, for some stupid reason, are over-complicated and don't hold a candle to anything you could get through a console (such as a PS4). Simply put: I don't use a single function that the TV came with, and instead prefer to use whatever device/console I have connected. While this may be a tiny tad more time-consuming, I find 3rd party apps/sources to still be a bit more intuitive and convenient than the in-born Samsung apps.<br /><br />In general, this particular TV is a bit disappointing in comparison to what I paid for it.

"I owned most of the Amazon products, starting with some old kindles (x3), fire phone (x3), fire hd tablets (x4) and many many echo products. Although I disagree with most of the bad reviews on the fire phone (I liked it/them very much), I tend to agree with those reviewers who complain about the echo buds.<br /><br />Let me first say that Echo Buds is a product that Amazon should design, develop, and keep. It complements the ecosystem of the echo product line and its existence would put pressure on other manufacturers to do even better job improving their Alexa-compatible earbuds. But Amazon has to do it right.<br /><br />Here comes the product review. Echo Buds is a failed product and has to be improved.<br /><br />It is an earbud. So it should sound right in the first place. And to sound right, electric noise is the first enemy. It is hard to justify a $130 earbud with high level of electric noise like the echo buds. The electric noise makes the echo buds unusable for music (I believe it is absolutely meaningless to talk about lows-. mids- or highs- in the music under the high level of electric noise.)<br /><br />It is an Alexa-native earbud. So it is supposed to work flawlessly with voice command etc. It does, most of the time. I'd wish Amazon can add ID to echo devices so that if I'm wearing the buds and want to start music for my kids on another echo speaker, the system won't be confused. (It might have this function now, but I found my bud always hijack the commands).<br /><br />And the buttons/pushes on the buds almost never work. Google Assistant never worked, the passthrough switching stopped working etc. And its bluetooth caused some trouble with my Win10 laptop when switching on and off.<br /><br />All in all, Amazon needs Echo Buds, and a much improved one.",2.0,i owned most of the amazon products starting with some old kindles x fire phone x fire hd tablets x and many many echo products although i disagree with most of the bad reviews on the fire phone i liked itthem very much i tend to agree with those reviewers who complain about the echo budsbr br let me first say that echo buds is a product that amazon should design develop and keep it complements the ecosystem of the echo product line and its existence would put pressure on other manufacturers to do even better job improving their alexacompatible earbuds but amazon has to do it rightbr br here comes the product review echo buds is a failed product and has to be improvedbr br it is an earbud so it should sound right in the first place and to sound right electric noise is the first enemy it is hard to justify a earbud with high level of electric noise like the echo buds the electric noise makes the echo buds unusable for music i believe it is absolutely meaningless to talk about lows mids or highs in the music under the high level of electric noisebr br it is an alexanative earbud so it is supposed to work flawlessly with voice command etc it does most of the time id wish amazon can add id to echo devices so that if im wearing the buds and want to start music for my kids on another echo speaker the system wont be confused it might have this function now but i found my bud always hijack the commandsbr br and the buttonspushes on the buds almost never work google assistant never worked the passthrough switching stopped working etc and its bluetooth caused some trouble with my win laptop when switching on and offbr br all in all amazon needs echo buds and a much improved one,1696

"I purchased this projection screen to improve the image quality for my portable projector over the bare wall that I was using currently.  Unfortunately, I had to return it because it did not do what I needed.<br /><br />This projection screen is made of a translucent, white fabric that is quite stretchy, which are both bad properties to have for a front-projection screen.  Most people will be mounting their projection screen against a wall so being a translucent fabric, much of the projected light passes through the screen and hits the wall, then reflect back on to the screen.  The net effect of this is that there is a fuzzy glow around everything in the image.  Furthermore, being a stretchy fabric, you will end up with ugly curved edges in an effort to mount the screen tightly in order to remove any creases.<br /><br />What you end up with on your wall is something that looks like you skinned a polar bear and a projected image that is akin to looking through a thick layer of fog.<br /><br />I would not recommend this projection screen for anything other than a temporary screen that you might put up because there isn't a flat wall near by (camping?)",2.0,i purchased this projection screen to improve the image quality for my portable projector over the bare wall that i was using currently unfortunately i had to return it because it did not do what i neededbr br this projection screen is made of a translucent white fabric that is quite stretchy which are both bad properties to have for a frontprojection screen most people will be mounting their projection screen against a wall so being a translucent fabric much of the projected light passes through the screen and hits the wall then reflect back on to the screen the net effect of this is that there is a fuzzy glow around everything in the image furthermore being a stretchy fabric you will end up with ugly curved edges in an effort to mount the screen tightly in order to remove any creasesbr br what you end up with on your wall is something that looks like you skinned a polar bear and a projected image that is akin to looking through a thick layer of fogbr br i would not recommend this projection screen for anything other than a temporary screen that you might put up because there isnt a flat wall near by camping,1126

"I've used 6 routers in my life and helped set up another 8 different brands of routers.  These include the free with rebate variety, ones with custom firmware, and dinosaurs by todays standards (which ironically was free and now runs custom firmware).  This is perhaps the most ill prepared for the real world of the bunch.<br /><br />The hardware looks great on paper.  gigabit ethernet, every wireless spec, multiple radios, huge bandwidth amounts, and support for the new AC standard.  For a company just getting it's feet wet with routers, it's quite ambitious.  From the software side, it's more of the over simplified (so much so it makes advanced administering a bit of a challenge for those who know how to work a traditional router).  More than anything, it just doesn't work.  Connections come and go, it constantly needs rebooting, and it takes too much work to get it set up right.  The last bit seems to be true of WD routers, but at least my [[ASIN:B007KZQMO6 WD My Net N900 HD Dual Band Router Wireless N WiFi Router Accelerate HD]] worked more or less.  Here it's a whole lot of less.  Speeds are very good, albeit not earth shattering, and again it just isn't ready.  Firmware updates helped my N900, so I'm not writing this off entirely, but I'm reverting back to my old N900.<br /><br />If WD wants to make a name for itself, try making bulletproof routers for people who buy routers.  This is too simple for the average go out and buy a router just because it's better than what they already have crowd, and too pricy for someone who simply needs to get on the net.  A high end router should be easy for people who buy high end routers (and want to utilize their features), and more significantly, it should be bulletproof, as that's what we demand.<br /><br />I'll try this again in a while, or when I can get DD-WRT or some other 3rd party firmware installed.",2.0,ive used routers in my life and helped set up another different brands of routers these include the free with rebate variety ones with custom firmware and dinosaurs by todays standards which ironically was free and now runs custom firmware this is perhaps the most ill prepared for the real world of the bunchbr br the hardware looks great on paper gigabit ethernet every wireless spec multiple radios huge bandwidth amounts and support for the new ac standard for a company just getting its feet wet with routers its quite ambitious from the software side its more of the over simplified so much so it makes advanced administering a bit of a challenge for those who know how to work a traditional router more than anything it just doesnt work connections come and go it constantly needs rebooting and it takes too much work to get it set up right the last bit seems to be true of wd routers but at least my asinbkzqmo wd my net n hd dual band router wireless n wifi router accelerate hd worked more or less here its a whole lot of less speeds are very good albeit not earth shattering and again it just isnt ready firmware updates helped my n so im not writing this off entirely but im reverting back to my old nbr br if wd wants to make a name for itself try making bulletproof routers for people who buy routers this is too simple for the average go out and buy a router just because its better than what they already have crowd and too pricy for someone who simply needs to get on the net a high end router should be easy for people who buy high end routers and want to utilize their features and more significantly it should be bulletproof as thats what we demandbr br ill try this again in a while or when i can get ddwrt or some other rd party firmware installed,1769

"I recently bought a few types of headphones for various different reasons. I was actually most excited about these. As someone who has a handful different Anker products I have never been let down by them..... until now.<br /><br />These look amazing. They have a really nice build that is great fitting. Super adjustable. Fits all hat sizes from children to size 8 very comfortably. Nice ear pads that rotate, everything you could want in design.<br /><br />I attached them to my computer via Bluetooth (super easy) and tried out videoconferencing. I can hear the people on the other end (we tested in the same house a hundred feet away) awesomely - but they hear cracking noises every few seconds so they can only make out every other word essentially. I go to switch places with them and yep, cracking noises. You can’t make out the person on the other end really.<br /><br />Okay I think, let’s try using with the phone instead. I plug back in to charge (even though it was fully charged already) and wait until the next day. The next day I try them again when making a phone call via Bluetooth. Again, setup is easy. I can hear the person on the other end of the line perfectly. They actually ask if I am driving because they are having a tough time hearing me. Like I am going through a tunnel. I am sitting on a couch inside. I switch to another headset and they can hear me perfectly.<br /><br />Unfortunately these are great in design, and great for listening to things. If that is all you are primarily doing these might be good for you as the noise canceling was pretty good. Could hardly hear people yelling from 10 feet away. However, if you are going to use them to talk on a phone or use to videoconference then these will not work for you, and was why I specifically bought these as they were supposed to be able to do that.

"This is my second Swann security camera system. Had the firs one for years untill it was damaged by flod, so I decided to get an updated version. The new system proved to be very unreliable, one camera failed after about one month. Firs, here are some things that I like about it: good picture quality, easy to install and configure, mobile app works well on newer devices. Now for the not so good part: the video quality is not very good, It produces bright and detailed image but the motion is terrible due to a low maximum video refresh rate of only 15 frames per second. As the result the video is not smooth, but rather chopy. Night vision producers a hot spot in the middle of the frame and the rest if the image is much darker. The cat 5e cables that came with the system are of poor quality and were wound so tight that I couldn't straighten out all the kinks. As I mentioned before, one camera failed after about a month. Called tech support and spent a while on hold until I decided to leave a message. They did call me back in about 20 minutes. After I explained to them all the troubleshooting steps that I took (I have 20 years IT experience and have a degree in electronics) they referred me to a second level support. I had to email them all the details and the steps I took to troubleshoot. They asked me to swap the camera with one that worked which is not an easy task as all the cables were installed throughout the house and all the cameras were mounted outside. I told them that I already bought a new cable and ran it to the camera as well as tried several ports on the NVR, but they insisted... Fine, I tried that, same results. After close to a week of emailing back and forth, (their response time was quite quick but I needed to find time to do what they were asking me to do) they finally concluded that the camera was defective and issued an RMA. I sent the camera back, still waiting for replacement. I was uncomfortable with being without one camera for several weeks so I decided to buy a spare. After installing it, it worked fine for several days, but after the system reboots as part of the maintenance process which is set to once a day by default, the new camera fails to start half the time. As a work-around I set the reboot to once a month and will try to replace the cable when I have time. All in all, I am not happy with the system as so far it proovd to be very unreliable.",2.0,this is my second swann security camera system had the firs one for years untill it was damaged by flod so i decided to get an updated version the new system proved to be very unreliable one camera failed after about one month firs here are some things that i like about it good picture quality easy to install and configure mobile app works well on newer devices now for the not so good part the video quality is not very good it produces bright and detailed image but the motion is terrible due to a low maximum video refresh rate of only frames per second as the result the video is not smooth but rather chopy night vision producers a hot spot in the middle of the frame and the rest if the image is much darker the cat e cables that came with the system are of poor quality and were wound so tight that i couldnt straighten out all the kinks as i mentioned before one camera failed after about a month called tech support and spent a while on hold until i decided to leave a message they did call me back in about minutes after i explained to them all the troubleshooting steps that i took i have years it experience and have a degree in electronics they referred me to a second level support i had to email them all the details and the steps i took to troubleshoot they asked me to swap the camera with one that worked which is not an easy task as all the cables were installed throughout the house and all the cameras were mounted outside i told them that i already bought a new cable and ran it to the camera as well as tried several ports on the nvr but they insisted fine i tried that same results after close to a week of emailing back and forth their response time was quite quick but i needed to find time to do what they were asking me to do they finally concluded that the camera was defective and issued an rma i sent the camera back still waiting for replacement i was uncomfortable with being without one camera for several weeks so i decided to buy a spare after installing it it worked fine for several days but after the system reboots as part of the maintenance process which is set to once a day by default the new camera fails to start half the time as a workaround i set the reboot to once a month and will try to replace the cable when i have time all in all i am not happy with the system as so far it proovd to be very unreliable,2357

"Wierd issue connecting. Get rid of the verbal connecting firmware and it will probably work fine. Gimmicky connection, doesn't auto reconnect all the time, even during testing, let alone if you walk away and come back - turned on or off, with or with out the Bluetooth button.

The sound on this is awesome and very loud. I love everything about it except the bluetooth, which basically renders it useless or limits you to an aux cord :( I called multiple times, few emails, and even a text to ION I recieved no response, even after a month.

"Let me start off by saying that Braun makes the best electric shavers I've used. I've stuck with them for more than 15 years. When the battery on my 5614 stopped holding a charge I decided to upgrade to the 8585. It is much better than the 5614 for getting tough areas along the sides of the neck and base of the jaw. In fact, there is really no comparison between the 5000 series and the 8000 series. The 8585 blows this thing away... it really is worth the extra money. Don't be cheap, upgrade. You won't regret it. The new micro screen's shape really does pick-up more hair in less strokes. Combined with the side-to-side vibration that really does cut down on razor burn. It's quieter too. While it's not quite as good as an old fashioned blade it's much better than any electric I've ever used.<br /><br />Couple hints for maximum performance: The clean and charge refills are very expensive. If you only use that feature once a week you can maintain high performance with much less cost. In between, simply remove the micro screen and blow the hairs off the blades each time. Just takes a second. If you gently drop the micro screen an inch or two onto a hard surface like the sink it will jar loose any hairs stuck therein.

"The Motorola T200 walkie talkie series seems to be a stripped-down version of the (very) slightly more expensive T260 model. They look exactly the same and even come with the same instruction manual. The major difference seems to be that the T260 includes NOAA weather band coverage and the T200 doesn't. Oddly, the T260 model claims to operate up to 25 miles away, while the T200 has a maximum rated distance of 20 miles. I would love to know how the manufacturer came up with these estimations.<br /><br />First of all, unless you are literally in space, there is absolutely no chance that you will get 25 or even 20 miles of coverage with these radios. Even 1 mile of coverage is an extreme stretch in most situations. A few hundred yards, perhaps, but that is about it. There are a few things that irk me about this radio, besides the vastly exaggerated range. For one, no specs are provided as to what output power these units operate at. You can't compare apples to apples against other radios unless you know the actual specs and this radio lists almost no meaningful specifications.<br /><br />Another pet peeve I have is the slightly misleading claim of having 22 channels. Of those 22 channels, 8 are solely reserved for GMRS services (channels 15-22). You need a license from the Federal Communications Commission to operate on these channels and a GMRS license application currently runs close to $100. If you do not have a GMRS license for those channels and fail to use your FCC callsign, you are breaking the law.<br /><br />The whole &quot;privacy codes&quot; issue is a gimmick that many cheap radio manufacturers use. There is no privacy on these frequencies. Using them does not &quot;scramble&quot; your signal nor make it unavailable to others. It simply means that you will not be able to hear other users on your same frequency while the feature is in use. So, everyone can hear you, but you can't hear them. I'm not quite sure how that equals privacy.<br /><br />Those issues aside, the radio pretty much falls into the &quot;average&quot; category when it comes to FRS radios. There are no extra features like NOAA weather alerts, FM Radio reception, broadband scanning, detachable antennas, offset frequency storage for accessing GMRS repeaters, hi/lo transmit power function, programmable display, LED flashlight with strobe, Bluetooth headset compatibility,manually adjustable squelch, RF meter, etc.  I could go on and on with the features it DOESN'T have, but you get the idea.<br /><br />On the positive side, this radio can be used with either alkaline or (included) NiMH battery packs and claims to operate for up to 20 hours on a single charge. I am guessing that this claim either precludes transmitting or that the transmit power level is so low as to hardly drain the batteries. I would be shocked if this model transmitted using even 1 Watt of power. That's great for preventing battery drain but reduces its effective range dramatically.<br /><br />On another note, another reviewer here mentioned that this radio communicated with other &quot;CB&quot; radios. These radios do not operate on Citizen's Band frequencies. CB Radio uses frequencies in the 26-27MHz range. These radios operate in the 460+MHz range. CB radios can operate at much greater distances and transmit using significantly more power (around 4 Watts). They are in no way compatible with these radios that operate in the Family Radio Service (FRS) band and the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) band.<br /><br />In short, this is a pretty average FRS/GMRS radio that has a very short range. It just barely operates at a capacity beyond line-of-sight. For a few dollars more you can find models with many more features which will transmit/receive significantly further. If someone is close enough for you to actually see them, this radio will probably work fine. Just don't expect much beyond that.",2.0,the motorola t walkie talkie series seems to be a strippeddown version of the very slightly more expensive t model they look exactly the same and even come with the same instruction manual the major difference seems to be that the t includes noaa weather band coverage and the t doesnt oddly the t model claims to operate up to miles away while the t has a maximum rated distance of miles i would love to know how the manufacturer came up with these estimationsbr br first of all unless you are literally in space there is absolutely no chance that you will get or even miles of coverage with these radios even mile of coverage is an extreme stretch in most situations a few hundred yards perhaps but that is about it there are a few things that irk me about this radio besides the vastly exaggerated range for one no specs are provided as to what output power these units operate at you cant compare apples to apples against other radios unless you know the actual specs and this radio lists almost no meaningful specificationsbr br another pet peeve i have is the slightly misleading claim of having channels of those channels are solely reserved for gmrs services channels you need a license from the federal communications commission to operate on these channels and a gmrs license application currently runs close to if you do not have a gmrs license for those channels and fail to use your fcc callsign you are breaking the lawbr br the whole quotprivacy codesquot issue is a gimmick that many cheap radio manufacturers use there is no privacy on these frequencies using them does not quotscramblequot your signal nor make it unavailable to others it simply means that you will not be able to hear other users on your same frequency while the feature is in use so everyone can hear you but you cant hear them im not quite sure how that equals privacybr br those issues aside the radio pretty much falls into the quotaveragequot category when it comes to frs radios there are no extra features like noaa weather alerts fm radio reception broadband scanning detachable antennas offset frequency storage for accessing gmrs repeaters hilo transmit power function programmable display led flashlight with strobe bluetooth headset compatibilitymanually adjustable squelch rf meter etc i could go on and on with the features it doesnt have but you get the ideabr br on the positive side this radio can be used with either alkaline or included nimh battery packs and claims to operate for up to hours on a single charge i am guessing that this claim either precludes transmitting or that the transmit power level is so low as to hardly drain the batteries i would be shocked if this model transmitted using even watt of power thats great for preventing battery drain but reduces its effective range dramaticallybr br on another note another reviewer here mentioned that this radio communicated with other quotcbquot radios these radios do not operate on citizens band frequencies cb radio uses frequencies in the mhz range these radios operate in the mhz range cb radios can operate at much greater distances and transmit using significantly more power around watts they are in no way compatible with these radios that operate in the family radio service frs band and the general mobile radio service gmrs bandbr br in short this is a pretty average frsgmrs radio that has a very short range it just barely operates at a capacity beyond lineofsight for a few dollars more you can find models with many more features which will transmitreceive significantly further if someone is close enough for you to actually see them this radio will probably work fine just dont expect much beyond that,3687

Actually quite a surprising lack of features from a D-Link router. Biggest issue was the inability to accept special characters as part of the logon password. In this day and age - that is simply ridiculous and provides a significant security hole. The second surprise was that there are no holes for wall mounting - which one would clearly expect on a wireless device. So this is desktop only. I have also noted what appears to be  a significant variation in wireless output for no apparent reason. Fortunately none of these issues greatly affect my current application so I elected not to return it but would recommend finding a different solution if you are worried about any of these problems.,2.0,actually quite a surprising lack of features from a dlink router biggest issue was the inability to accept special characters as part of the logon password in this day and age that is simply ridiculous and provides a significant security hole the second surprise was that there are no holes for wall mounting which one would clearly expect on a wireless device so this is desktop only i have also noted what appears to be a significant variation in wireless output for no apparent reason fortunately none of these issues greatly affect my current application so i elected not to return it but would recommend finding a different solution if you are worried about any of these problems,684

"We bought this Blu Ray player 3.5 years ago.  At first I was pretty happy, but as time has gone by I've found it struggles with certain discs.  And I'm not referring to damaged discs.  We just opened the 50th Anniversary Blu Ray for My Fair Lady, discs and new and look great.  About an hour into the movie it was stuttering horribly.  This is not a known issue with this movie.  I unplugged the player from AC power, and tried again.  Started at the previous chapter, and it played through the scene that had stuttered previously without a hitch!  I thought I was in the clear.  10 minutes later, it starts again.  Again, a full power down fixes it, for about 10-15 minutes, then it starts again.  I finally stopped trying the Blu Ray and switched to the included DVD instead, and managed to watch without issue the rest of the way.  There's no reason for it to be overheating, and, we don't watch that many movies.  This player probably has 200 hours of total use on it.  Disappointed.  No firmware updates available.

"Summary: Komputerbay memory doesn't appear to be reliable - if you care about stability then spend more on another brand.<br /><br />This is a combined review for [[ASIN:B006JO2KXQ Komputerbay 32GB ( 4 X 8GB ) DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz DIMM with Low Profile Blue Heatspreaders 240-Pin Dual / Quad Channel RAM Desktop Memory KIT 9-9-9-24 XMP ready]] as well as [[ASIN:B00698WP50 Komputerbay 16GB (2x 8GB) DDR3 PC3-10600 10666 1333MHz SODIMM 204-Pin Laptop Memory 9-9-9-25]], both of which I purchased earlier this summer. The desktop set was for my Windows 7 desktop (a custom build) and the laptop memory was for my Macbook Pro late 2011 model.<br /><br />I've been a systems administrator professionally for twelve years now, and have messed around with computers my whole life. I've learned that it's always a good idea to test new memory with Memtest86+ overnight at the very least, which is what I did upon receiving both sets of Komputerbay memory. There is a MemTest application for Mac OSX that I used, which is a little different from Memtest86+, but seems to work in a similar way. What I've found is that bad memory fails memory tests almost immediately, so it's not hard to tell if you've gotten a set with one or more bad modules right away.<br /><br />Both sets of memory from my first order failed memory tests immediately. I decided I wasn't going to fool around with my Mac so I returned the Komputerbay laptop memory and ordered [[ASIN:B006DI9PG8 Corsair 16GB Dual Channel DDR3 SODIMM Memory Kit (CMSO16GX3M2A1333C9)]], which passed thorough memory testing. My Macbook Pro has been totally stable for almost three months.<br /><br />I did, however, decide to give Komputerbay another chance with the desktop memory so I ordered another set of [[ASIN:B006JO2KXQ Komputerbay 32GB ( 4 X 8GB ) DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz DIMM with Low Profile Blue Heatspreaders 240-Pin Dual / Quad Channel RAM Desktop Memory KIT 9-9-9-24 XMP ready]] after returning the bad set. Komputerbay was still quite a bit cheaper for 32GB of memory and I figured that hey, every manufacturer has a bad module now and then (although I can't remember the last time I had a bad memory module out of hundreds of desktop, server and laptop memory modules I've purchased).<br /><br />When I received the new Komputerbay 32GB desktop set, I tested them thoroughly with Memtest86+, of course. All tests passed overnight and since this was a brand new desktop I had just built, I decided to do some burn-in testing with IntelBurnTest and Prime95, both of which stress the CPU and memory pretty extensively (one could say the system as a whole is well tested). If memory passes Memtest86+ and the system remains stable after a few IntelBurnTest and Prime95 runs, it's been my experience that it's a good bet that the system is going to run stable even under the heaviest of loads.<br /><br />What I found odd is that the Komputerbay 32GB kit passed thorough Memtest86+ testing, but Prime95 workers would die with errors which usually means something is wrong with the underlying hardware. I did a ton of research on this and could find nothing conclusive as to why Memtest86+ tests would pass yet Prime95 would fail (my CPU temps were well within range). I chalked it up to an anomaly and decided to let it go. I just assumed the memory was good, and maybe Prime95 was failing on new hardware or something.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could never seem to get my desktop to run stable. It would run fine for several days to over a week, and then my system would crash (blue screen of death or BSOD) with a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error. This usually means bad memory or a bad driver, and many forums would say ""test with Memtest86+!"" and most of the time people would report back that they indeed had a bad memory module. Of course I had already done this, several times, and each test PASSED for me. This was mind boggling. I ran WhoCrashed to analyze the crash dump files, but all it told me was:<br /><br />crash dump file: C:\Windows\Minidump\090212-9625-01.dmp<br />This was probably caused by the following module: ntoskrnl.exe (nt+0x7F1C0)<br />Bugcheck code: 0x1A (0x41790, 0xFFFFFA8012EDF3F0, 0xFFFF, 0x0)<br />Error: MEMORY_MANAGEMENT<br />file path: C:\Windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe<br />product: Microsoft® Windows® Operating System<br />company: Microsoft Corporation<br />description: NT Kernel & System<br />Bug check description: This indicates that a severe memory management error occurred. This might be a case of memory corruption. More often memory corruption happens because of software errors in buggy drivers, not because of faulty RAM modules. The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver which cannot be identified at this time.<br /><br />What I found in my research, however, was that MEMORY_MANAGEMENT errors typically were due to faulty memory modules! But again, the Komputerbay memory was passing all memory tests! I just couldn't seem to narrow down the MEMORY_MANAGEMENT errors to something specific.<br /><br />I spent several hours researching and testing various things out but could never seem to figure out what was going on. I couldn't point to any one thing as conclusively being the culprit, but I just couldn't get over how Prime95 was failing. This has NEVER happened before on many system builds. On a gut level, I felt that it had to be the memory, somehow, but couldn't prove it. The only anomaly I was experiencing with with Prime95, and of course the crashing every 1-2 weeks. Every other test passed.<br /><br />I finally got fed up a few weeks ago and decided to replace the Komputerbay memory with a set of [[ASIN:B0033BTACM Kingston Technology HyperX 16 GB Kit (4x4 GB Modules) 16 Quad Channel Kit 1600 (PC3 12800) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM KHX1600C9D3K4/16GX]], which is also certified to work with my [[ASIN:B005FGMQAQ ASRock MB-P67E4G3 LGA 1155 Intel P67 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard]]. I don't know if this makes much difference, but I wanted to be extra safe. My desktop HAS to be extremely stable for the work I do, and I was tired of losing so much productivity over this.<br /><br />Yesterday I experienced another BSOD (of course right when I had a ton of stuff open), so I decided it was time to install the Kingston memory (I haven't had time). So far I've run Memtest86+ overnight, a few IntelBurnTest runs and several hours of Prime95. Absolutely everything has passed - all Prime95 threads were running stable after several hours, where as before with the Komputerbay memory, a few threads would die with errors almost immediately.<br /><br />I still don't know if the Komputerbay memory was bad, or if it was just a combination of my motherboard and the memory, or something else. All I know is Prime95 would fail with the Komputerbay memory, and has run successfully with the Kingston memory for several hours. So far my desktop appears to be running stable - we'll see if I have any more BSODs over the coming weeks. At this point, I'm highly confident I won't.<br /><br />If you care at all about productivity and you need your systems to run stable, then I don't recommend you purchase any memory from Komputerbay. Spend extra on G.Skill, Crucial, Kingston, etc. Either way, I highly recommend thoroughly testing ANY new memory modules in the manner I described above.",2.0,summary komputerbay memory doesnt appear

"There are a lot of problems with Nest/Dropcam. Some of the problems are:<br /><br />1) Dropcam was purchased by Google not too long ago. Google is a massive company with ample resources but they are completely reluctant to invest in this company to make it a good buy for customers.<br /><br />2) They have very inexperienced people for tech support and you will spend hours on the phone. Ultimately, you will get nowhere because the technical problems are inherent to their system.<br /><br />3) You must rely on ISP-provided bandwidth and the ISP providers are cheating us out of the bandwidth we pay for, (I found this with Verizon and Frontier) so the cameras don't work well. Google needs to own a bandwidth company and provide enough levels and packages of bandwidth for its Dropcam customers to allow multiple cameras to work well. If you only need one camera, then possibly this system might work for you if you only need very basic services. Otherwise, the lack of enough bandwidth and the photo array display will cause immediate problems.<br /><br />4) When I got my first Dropcam camera, I was told that I would be billed ten dollars a year for the first camera and half that for each subsequent camera. These prices are now monthly.<br /><br />5) You get thumbnail individual shots for the recorded history (not video streaming film). Because the individual pictures are taken at intervals, they do not always report what is going on. Recently, there were eight people in a cottage on my property. The intermittent pictures did not contain even ONE shot of all of those eight people having been there. I have had this system for several years and I have not been able to capture even one picture of the people who have been repeatedly burglarizing my home and the cottage.<br /><br />6) The thumbnail pictures are too small and difficult to review and the quality is poor. Details are often lost; like the features on a person's face. If you try and call it up into the larger screen, it will not give you the picture you are trying to review; it will give you a &#34;stock&#34; picture of the room minus the people you are trying to see.<br /><br />7) The cameras are not a high quality. They respond in bizarre ways to the light at different times of the day. The cameras are supposed to report in color; the thumbnail pictures from the array only report in black and white.

"I find myself disappointed. These buds held such promise but for me, they just didn't rise to the challenge. At first, the many options available to find the perfect fit were impressive. There's a wide selection of tips, and even some wings, for that extra snug fit. Seems like there should be a good fit in there somewhere, right? Not so much. Using the blue tips and wings, jamming the buds deep into my ears, I can get very good sound, plenty of bass. But it's really kind of painful. Using the red tips and the wings, I can get a comfortable fit that seems well seated, but then the sound is shallow, with no depth. Though still crisp, it's almost tinny. Other aspects: Setup is easy, as with all things Alexa and there are some controls you can tweak in the app, though I found adjustments had limited results. I haven't used the buds for anything but music so far, so haven't given them any commands.  The sound cancellation and pass-through features do seem to make a difference, though not to an impressive level. Battery life seems good so far. So while they got some things right, comfort and sound quality are two heavy hitters and if you don't have them - at the same time - you've got a problem.

I use these almost daily and probably more than most. The sound quality is great for both phone and Bluetooth radio. The only issue I’ve had out of three pairs is the answer/on/off button under the rubber cover keeps coming apart. You can hear something rattling inside and when this happens it will not turn back on or you have to press really hard. If this was changed so not an issue this would be awesome.

"I got this stylus after using a regular bamboo stylus (non-bluetooth) and wanting a more precise writing experience. Sadly, I did not get it.<br /><br />I charged the stylus for 2 hours prior to attempting to connect. Using the bamboo paper app I was able to connect after two tries. From then, the stylus stayed connected and would reconnect easily if I left and then returned to the app.<br /><br />Design wise, the Fineline is comfortable to hold and has a nice weight to it. The cap snaps on and off cleanly, but does not sit on the back too well. I ended up simply resting the cap on my desk with I was writing with it.<br /><br />A minor issue that I had with the Fineline is the noise that it made when contacting the screen of the iPad. As the tip is pretty hard, there was a noticeable clicking sound that accompanied writing. Others have noted this as well, so I wasn't surprised that it occurred, I just found it a bit too loud for my liking.<br /><br />However, my main issue is the same as others have noted: the offset. Simply put, unless you hold the stylus at a very specific angle, your writing will not be very close to the tip of the stylus. You can actually see where the pen will write if you use the eraser tool (by either pushing the assigned button on the stylus, or by selecting the tool on the Paper app): if you touch the stylus to the screen a little circle will appear, showing you the area that will be erased. If you hold the stylus on the screen and then alter the angle of the tip you'll see the tiny circle move toward and away from the tip of the stylus depending on the angle. In my experience, to get the erase circle right under the tip of the stylus, I had to hold it at an uncomfortable angle. This made it all but impossible to comfortably write more than a word or two at a time.<br /><br />I'm returning this as I simply cannot use it to take notes due to the writing issue described above. I can't speak to how well it would do as a drawing device as I didn't get it for that reason.",2.0,i got this stylus after using a regular bamboo stylus nonbluetooth and wanting a more precise writing experience sadly i did not get itbr br i charged the stylus for hours prior to attempting to connect using the bamboo paper app i was able to connect after two tries from then the stylus stayed connected and would reconnect easily if i left and then returned to the appbr br design wise the fineline is comfortable to hold and has a nice weight to it the cap snaps on and off cleanly but does not sit on the back too well i ended up simply resting the cap on my desk with i was writing with itbr br a minor issue that i had with the fineline is the noise that it made when contacting the screen of the ipad as the tip is pretty hard there was a noticeable clicking sound that accompanied writing others have noted this as well so i wasnt surprised that it occurred i just found it a bit too loud for my likingbr br however my main issue is the same as others have noted the offset simply put unless you hold the stylus at a very specific angle your writing will not be very close to the tip of the stylus you can actually see where the pen will write if you use the eraser tool by either pushing the assigned button on the stylus or by selecting the tool on the paper app if you touch the stylus to the screen a little circle will appear showing you the area that will be erased if you hold the stylus on the screen and then alter the angle of the tip youll see the tiny circle move toward and away from the tip of the stylus depending on the angle in my experience to get the erase circle right under the tip of the stylus i had to hold it at an uncomfortable angle this made it all but impossible to comfortably write more than a word or two at a timebr br im returning this as i simply cannot use it to take notes due to the writing issue described above i cant speak to how well it would do as a drawing device as i didnt get it for that reason,1950

"UPDATE 05/15/2021 - It lasted less than two weeks and it died. During playback the player freezes on discs known to be good, and in order to get6 the player to respond I have to disconnect the power from it. It was great while it lasted, I guess.<br /><br />Original review follows.<br /><br />===<br /><br />I have wanted a Blu-Ray player for a while and I have had reason to suspect that my DVD player is dying. I have a flat-screen Sony television so I figured this player would connect and work with it without too much effort. I was right and it has worked very well for my family and me.<br /><br />This is a straightforward device. I connected it to the TV via the provided HDMI cable, selected that input and immediately was able to get signal from it. I popped in a disc and it loaded up to the menu. That’s exactly what I expected to happen. In operation using the remote it has worked very much like my old DVD player – remote is laid out a bit differently but the operation is the same and it provides buttons to stop, fast forward and reverse, pause, eject, select the root menu and more. The remote had given us no issues so far, though it does need to have near line-of-site with the player in order for the player to see it and respond.<br /><br />The footprint is much smaller than my older DVD player and required a bit of rearrangement in my entertainment center. The whole unit is smaller than a ream of paper and weighs next to nothing.<br /><br />It has built-in WiFi and makes it easy to access online streaming services. However, I will confess that I haven’t yet tried this as I try to keep my WiFi device list small. I will experiment with this when there is time.<br /><br />So far we have seen no issues with playback – no skips or stutters or freezes. I have a couple of discs that I know to cause issues for my DVD player that I will try in this player and see if it fares better, though I believe the discs are actually bad.<br /><br />So far I have had a positive experience with this player and based on that I am happy to recommend it. It seems to work well and it is easy to understand and operate. It isn’t particularly expensive either which is a big plus.",2.0,update it lasted less than two weeks and it died during playback the player freezes on discs known to be good and in order to get the player to respond i have to disconnect the power from it it was great while it lasted i guessbr br original review followsbr br br br i have wanted a bluray player for a while and i have had reason to suspect that my dvd player is dying i have a flatscreen sony television so i figured this player would connect and work with it without too much effort i was right and it has worked very well for my family and mebr br this is a straightforward device i connected it to the tv via the provided hdmi cable selected that input and immediately was able to get signal from it i popped in a disc and it loaded up to the menu thats exactly what i expected to happen in operation using the remote it has worked very much like my old dvd player remote is laid out a bit differently but the operation is the same and it provides buttons to stop fast forward and reverse pause eject select the root menu and more the remote had given us no issues so far though it does need to have near lineofsite with the player in order for the player to see it and respondbr br the footprint is much smaller than my older dvd player and required a bit of rearrangement in my entertainment center the whole unit is smaller than a ream of paper and weighs next to nothingbr br it has builtin wifi and makes it easy to access online streaming services however i will confess that i havent yet tried this as i try to keep my wifi device list small i will experiment with this when there is timebr br so far we have seen no issues with playback no skips or stutters or freezes i have a couple of discs that i know to cause issues for my dvd player that i will try in this player and see if it fares better though i believe the discs are actually badbr br so far i have had a positive experience with this player and based on that i am happy to recommend it it seems to work well and it is easy to understand and operate it isnt particularly expensive either which is a big plus,2083

"I have tried many ergonomic keyboards. I had high hopes for this one. But it has too many flaws for me to recommend it.<br /><br />I like the feel of the keys and the amount of resistance when pressing them.

A keyboard that doesn’t reliably register the key you press is a failure, regardless of any other virtues it might have.<br /><br />The ergonomics are mixed. The wrist rest is comfortable. But the there is a little too much angle in the two sections of the keyboard. Instead of typing with your arms relaxed at your side, you have to hold out your elbows to get the correct hand angle. That gets pretty uncomfortable.<br /><br />The key layout also has flaws. The ends of the row of number key are a long, awkward stretch that requires touch typists to hunt and peck. The print screen key is huge and right by the backspace key. It’s easy to miss the backspace and get print screen instead. The speaker control function keys are not as easy to locate as on other keyboards and are hard to identify in dim light. Worse, I also experienced the problem that other users have reported where the volume up key seems to stick on. When this happens the volume goes to maximum and you are unable to lower it without rebooting. Another deal breaker.

"I was excited about purchasing both a screen cover and keyboard cover together, but I'll be returning this substandard product. It's probably best to go with manufacturers who focus on each of these 2 items.<br /><br />1. The screen cover is easy to install but it FAR too drastically darkens the screen (yes, even when I'm right in front of it).

bought for a canon rebel xs camera. camera is about 8 years old. camera will not format the card. I was told by camera expert these may not work on older cameras as in my case it did not . also it seems someone else may have purchased this first and returned as the top of the card looks like it had been filed down with a nail file or something or something similar. so i order a different brand 16 gb card for 7.49 and it worked just great .camera recongized the 16gb card and camera did format it. So may not be your product just not compatible with my 8 year old canon rebel xs camera. wont buy again. i had purchased one before 32mb scandisk for my kindle hd8 i inserted the correct way and it got stuck in the slot. so i ended up giving my new kindle away and had to order a new kindle hd 8 all over again.,2.0,bought for a canon rebel xs camera camera is about years old camera will not format the card i was told by camera expert these may not work on older cameras as in my case it did not also it seems someone else may have purchased this first and returned as the top of the card looks like it had been filed down with a nail file or something or something similar so i order a different brand gb card for and it worked just great camera recongized the gb card and camera did format it so may not be your product just not compatible with my year old canon rebel xs camera wont buy again i had purchased one before mb scandisk for my kindle hd i inserted the correct way and it got stuck in the slot so i ended up giving my new kindle away and had to order a new kindle hd all over again,781

"I would start by saying this is not a well-designed power supply. I know its not fair to expect the quality of BK precision or Magna from a $15 power supply, but there are some things that could have been easily implemented to make it at least user-friendly. When you turn on the adapter knob, some random voltage number appears and then it switches to the minimum of 3.43V (weird number). The knob is more sensitive than feather-touch as the slightest touch would change the voltage. Also, despite of having more margin to rotate the knob, it reaches the maximum of 24V early enough. Most probably the knob is a potentiometer so by using one with more turns can make it easier to change the output voltage. It took me a while to set the voltage to exact values to capture images. I WOULD NOT USE THIS ADAPTER TO POWER ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES PRECISE VOLTAGE. If the circuit/equipment has built-in voltage regulator, then this unit can be used to provide the coarse input voltage.",2.0,i would start by saying this is not a welldesigned power supply i know its not fair to expect the quality of bk precision or magna from a power supply but there are some things that could have been easily implemented to make it at least userfriendly when you turn on the adapter knob some random voltage number appears and then it switches to the minimum of v weird number the knob is more sensitive than feathertouch as the slightest touch would change the voltage also despite of having more margin to rotate the knob it reaches the maximum of v early enough most probably the knob is a potentiometer so by using one with more turns can make it easier to change the output voltage it took me a while to set the voltage to exact values to capture images i would not use this adapter to power anything that requires precise voltage if the circuitequipment has builtin voltage regulator then this unit can be used to provide the coarse input voltage,948

"Bought this router based on the seeminly rave reviews here and elsewhere. It may actually be a good router but set aside LOTS of time to set it up. I have set up dozens of routers for my self and friends. Never takes more than 5 minutes for the basics (maybe a bit longer for specific firewall rules). Not this router. EVERY change to EVERY page requires it to reboot. Reboot time is 40 - 60 seconds. It doesn't seem to matter what you change, it has to reboot. Sometimes it only takes 16 seconds (which is not actually true) when you just change a firewall rule so it evidently isn't a full reboot for some actions. Never the less it is ridiculous. I tried the automatic setup. Only got part way. Again, took WAY too much time - just to connaect the WAN - the first step. Then Buffalo wanted to store 3 cookies as part of the verification process. So I gave up on that as well.<br /><br />Even more ridiculous is it's password rules. The best way to maintain a secure password is to use random punctuation marks along with alphanumeric characters. This router does not permit the usage of punctuation marks in the password. It has probably been 3 or 4 years since I've encountered this archaic restriction and, in my view, should never be applied to a wireless internet router.<br /><br />Anyway the router is up and running and seems to work so we'll see.

"My first Kindle was a second gen with they keyboard.  I am not new to Kindle.  I've owned several at this point.  The last one(s) I bought were Kindle Voyage versions.  Both of which I actually bought as refurbs.  One last me me 6 years.  The other I've only had for a year or so.  Unfortunately both are starting to have issues.  I've replaced the battery in one, which was a bit of a pain but doable.  Since both are probably not going to last much longer I decided to suck it up and look at a new one.<br /><br />I'll be honest, the PW doesn't impress me.  At all.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  It's bigger than my Voyage.  It doesn't seem like it should make much of a difference, but it does.<br />2.  It's also heavier.<br />3.  Unfortunately I hate the touch screen as much as I thought I would.  If I want to advance a page, I don't want to only have to hit the right side of the screen.  If both my hands aren't free, or I have it positioned a certain way, then I either can't forward the page or I have to reach over it for every page turn.  If we have to do a touch screen (BRING BACK REAL BUTTONS AMAZON!!!  NOT THAT OASIS BS BUT AT THE VERY LEAST THE PAGE TURNS LIKE THE VOYAGE HAS), then why can't it be set up like the voyage and have the top half of the screen go backwards and the bottom go forward?  At least then you could touch it on either side to move it forward.  I'd actually give it another star for this.<br />4.  Because it's a touch screen and you HAVE to touch it to do ANYTHING, there's fingerprints.  So many fingerprints.  I'm going to have to wipe the screen off constantly just to make it readable.<br />5. The power button on the bottom is annoying.  Why not put it back on the back like the Voyage (And other models before it)?  It's so easy to hit there.<br />6.  Why is it when I hit the power button it has to boot up THEN I have to swipe it to bring it up?  So many steps.  Stop making the Kindle something it isn't.  I only want an Ereader.  That's it.  I don't need another tablet, phone or other electronic device. (Scribe anyone?)<br /><br />Pros/draw?<br />The text is crisp.  Not sure that it's any better than what I have already.<br />They have finally decided to charge with USB-C.  It's about time.<br /><br />In the end the special features the PW comes with: waterproof, warm light, etc don't mean anything to me.  TBH had they not been so close in price thanks to the holiday sale, I'd have bought the Kindle basic instead.  The Oasis has so many complaints about the battery life, and frankly the idiotic buttons are a total run off, that I don't want to go there.

"My phone would not always connect, forget about being able to read this in the day, even while it was in my electronics box and under a bimini shade it was barely readable. Note: The white backlight of the settings menu cannot be selected and light blue was the brightest. It did not connect easily to my phone via bluetooth when going from source to source or when restarting the boat after being off the boat. It's just not a fluid as my car's pioneer stereo for example. The backlight is probably the worst thing about this unit. You cannot get an LCD remote to fix this, I did add the remote that Kendwood had and it worked ok, but you have to guess when changing sources which is okay going to tuner (bc it would instantly make station noise), but not back to bluetooth - so then you get frustrated looking at the display again. Half of the remote lost back lighting within 6 months, which is okay really because I only noticed one night when we went out to watch the super blood moon last month. I do like the fact that I could talk to people via bluetooth no problems and that I could hear my phone ring when on the beach. I also like that with the remote I could turn up the music while driving, then back down when not,  for example when wakeboarding. Sound was great, radio receiving was not as good as my old sony, Lack of LCD remote is a deal breaker so I am leaning to Clarion or maybe Fusion if my wallet can afford fusion.

"Update 07/21/2021: I spoke too soon. This unit worked for about 3 minutes when I installed it and now it is very intermittent. It is not something that I recommend. I do applaud the sales person who tried to make it right but this is just not a reliable product. My email didn't work at all on the 5ghz setting but youtube worked for about 3 minutes. Now I can barely get it to work at all.  PASS on this product!!!<br /><br />Update 07/20/2021: I really needed to update my review to reflect not only the replacement device status but also the fact that this company was really addiment about making sure that I was a happy customer. I got the new replacement and was of course skeptical because the original product did not function well at all (see below, original review). This new replacement looks exactly like the one that did not work but I think the paperwork included may be different (not 100% sure). Anyway I did the same thing except this time It worked and it works well. My email does not seem to load very fast on the 5ghz connection but Rumble dot com which is a YouTube (IMHO communists) replacement website works great!

I will try it out and update my review accordingly, so stand by.<br /><br />I purchased this ROCK SPACE AC 1200 Dual Band WiFi Repeater because I have a low signal in the garage and my garage door has wi-fi capabilities. I was pretty happy to finally receive this repeater since amazon is no longer 2 days and more like 1 week. That however is a separate issue. So I got this set up and entered the passwords for the 2.4ghz and the 5 ghz and the 5ghz would not work at all. So I thought try the 2.4 ghz that should be all I need for the garage. Nope, it does work but it works about a third of the connection that I had with just the router. Keep in mind I have a high end router (Arris SurfBoard SVG2482AC) but lots of huge beams holding up my house so I need something to extend the signal into the garage and out to the front of the house.

"Was very excited to get this since this is the only way to show and share video in my car based on the fact there is no place else to hold the ipad for two kids.  I installed the device which is very simple.  However 3 things.  1) I hate that it makes a rattling noise none stop and it also makes a squeaking noise.  I hear the rattling coming from the area where the base and the ball that allows it to swivel are connected.  The squeaking is coming from the clamp that locks the two sliding poles.  Of course I made sure everything is tight and then very tight.  My husband is actually the one that installed and is writing the review here.  The 2nd thing is the clamp at the far end keeps popping open or disconnecting if you will.  No matter how much I tighten the screw into that clamp it still pops open.  See image I attached. I think they should insert a little foam like rubber seal around the clamps as well so that when it is wrapped around the metal headrest poles it can help grip against the metal and keep from sliding. Sometimes one end slides upward due to the very lightweight ipad air 2 being on the mount. The 3rd item is the way you mount the ipad.  You need to use all the hands.  That is fine when using this in a larger vehicle but the back seats are not the size of SUV seats so I have to get all bent over and squeeze around the two child booster seats to work the ipad off the mount. When you try to push down on the ipad (ipad air 2) to get the spring loaded clamps at the bottom to move down so I can slide out the ipad, the entire mount slants downward.  I have these extra Natmounts which are magentic mounts for ipads and phones.  I wanted to mount that onto the ipad mount and use the magentic on and off release instead of the clamps.

"UPDATE: 7/26/18<br />Lowering rating...again.  Jaybird has gone down hill.  I had to replace a new pair in January after unexplained problems with sound (crackling and inconsistent volume). Today, 6 months later, I discovered that the battery is expanding on the headset and has pushed the case open.  Jaybird is sending a replacement, but I felt like they were making it like they were doing me a big favor.  This is clearly a product failure, but because it was purchased just over a year ago, even with the replacement 6 months ago for a seperate failure they are declaring me out of warranty.  Over the few years that I've been buying their headphones, the average life expectancy for a pair appears to be 6 months, for the price this is not worth it.<br /><br />I started buying Jaybirds because they used to seem to really care about making a good product, and they seamed to be the best for athletes who sweat.  Now, it seems like they are just kicking out disposable products you will have to replace once a year. You'll spend  $$$ on their headphones that should last longer.  I'll use my replacement pair until they surely fail in some way in 3-6 months and then I will look for a better option.<br /><br />UPDATE: Ended up having to return another pair. FWIW, customer support had definitely gone down hill since the Logitech acquisition. The customer support staff is definitely under staffed, so plan lots of time if you try to chat them for help. Get ready for chatbots or chatbot like responses while you wait. I maintain my product review, but would lower Logitech/Jaybird support to stars a best.<br /><br />I've generally been a pretty big fan of Jaybird's products for a few years now.  I've had several pairs for one reason, I sweat a lot when I work out.  I first had the Jaybird X recommended to me by a co-worker because before Jaybird was acquired by Logitech they had basically a lifetime sweat resistance warranty.  I went through about 4 pairs over 2 years, again because of perspiration.  Every time Jaybird handled the warranty replacement in an exceptional way, even upgrading me twice because the equivalent replacement was out of stock or had been discontinued (X replaced with X2, X2 replaced with Freedom). They had me hooked as a customer. Unfortunately, it looks like they have now stepped back from this.  Freedoms only have a 1 year limited warranty and the lifetime sweat warranty is gone.  This is really too bad and as much a I like these it will be pretty big factor next time I need to replace my headphones. It's also why I'm only giving these a 3 star rating. If they had maintained their lifetime sweat warranty I would give these an instant 5 stars. Like I said, I've generally been pretty happy with Jaybird products and these are the best they have produced (IMO).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Best fitting Jaybird headphones I've had.  I've had the X and the X2 and these ones stay in ear the best of any of them.<br />-Good sound quality<br />-Charger/spare battery can be used like a portable spare.<br />-Basic bag case is the best design so far, no more clam shell oddities.<br />-Several sizing options for ear hooks and cups<br />-Good connectivity with my phone<br />-Can be paired with multiple devices.<br />-Good workout headphones. Can be worn in over or under configurations<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Reduced warranty time.<br />-Start-up/shutdown sound is stupidly loud.  It's sounds like it is designed just to show off the dynamic range. I already bought these you don't need to try to make them sound cool every time I turn them on or off.  Even at the lowest volume, it feels like the alerts are causing hearing damage. This is true of most alerts, your volume may be low and then the alert beep will be several times louder, they don't align.<br />-Volume adjustment is a bit more step like than smooth between levels.  Wish these had about double the number of volume steps.<br />-Charger/spare battery could easily be lost or misplaced.<br />-Charger/spare battery can be annoying during heavy workouts if attached, but is not too noticeable in other situations.<br />-Less power on the headphone string by itself.<br /><br />Other:<br />-App is nice, but frankly I only used it to set it up and create one equalization profile.  Frankly the idea of having tens of profiles and sharing them is kind of a waste of time to me.<br />-I think due to the smaller size, these fit in the ear really snug and cancel out a LOT of sound. In one sense this means they act almost like noise canceling headphones.  On the other side, they make it next to impossible to hear your surroundings, I typically have the volume at the lowest setting when I'm at the gym.

"I bought this clock after searching for an an ultra-accurate ""atomic"" clock that synchronizes by radio with the NIST laboratories' atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. A reviewer also referred to it as an atomic clock, but it is not. It simply has an internal back-up battery that keeps the clock running via a quartz crystal mechanism during power outages. The clock is said to be preset at the factory to EST, but mine must have been in stock along time because on plugging the radio in, the low battery light came on and the clock was several minutes wrong. The battery is an L-ion type and not cheap.<br /><br />AM reception is useless, the radio being very susceptible to noise on the power input line from things like dimmer-switches or phome chargers. The radio boasts no external antenna, instead it has a directional internal ferrite rod and the instructions tell you to rotate the radio for best reception, a pretty useless feature when you have to turn the clock display away from you.<br /><br />Even when operating simply as a clock, with the radio off, it makes a lot of noise if close to a smart phone that is receiving data.<br /><br />There are some good features. The display is large and easy read.

"This CyberPower CP850PFCLCD PFC Sinewave UPS System, 850VA/510W, isn't meeting my expectations.<br /><br />First, I get a lot of F02 and F03 errors. These come with a high pitched alarm at all hours, and sometimes with unexpected power loss. I tried troubleshooting with the help of the Amazon ""ask a question"" feature, and one smart individual suggested I could be putting too much load on the UPS. Worth a thought. I have a full-size high-end Dell desktop system that I use for editing videos for my YouTube channel, but even at peak startup it only burns about 100 W of power. So, I'm inclined to think it's not my system, it's the UPS.<br /><br />The second thing is more of an annoyance: the power management software is quirky. It frequently generates ""can not detect UPS"" errors, usually on startup, and the UI isn't the most intuitive or well-worded.<br /><br />I bought an APC system instead. It may not be a fair comparison in some ways because the APC has twice the VA, but it's working much better and the software is pleasing.<br /><br />I'm disappointed by this UPS in several ways. First, the product is generating F02 and F03 (apparently a sign of impending failure) error codes after only 2 years of light (if any) use.

"I really wanted to like this finder.  I take photos from a tripod at low angles sometimes, but not enough to justify the cost of the genuine Nikon.  The price of this one and the favorable reviews led me to order it.  Unfortunately it didn't work out and I had to return it.<br /><br />The deal breaker for me was poor optical quality.  The very center of the image was fine - I could see clearly and it was adequate for critical focusing.  But outside of the center 30% of the image things got really bad, so much that I could never really tell what was in or out of focus in the image.

"Ok quality cables. The little tabs on the bottom of the plug that hold the plug in the socket wore down quickly on both cables, so now the plugs fall out of my phone if I move it around.  That's annoying. I've had that problem on other economy cables. I like the cable length and braided sheath.  I also like the plastic ferrules around the metal of the plug, which I expect will give the cable extra protection from breaking at this common stress point.  All those features are wasted on a plug with inadequate spring prongs, though. I hope they find a better plug design (or material).

"I bought this Zagg case a few weeks back when my other Zagg keyboard got too worn down (the paint on some keys wore out and I couldn’t read them anymore!) and I was tired of the set-up I had of a purple iPad 4 case and the separate keyboard.<br /><br />Anyway, for $35 this was a deal I couldn’t pass up. The iPad 4 mini fits perfectly into it. If there’s a command window I can’t reach on the bottom of the screen, I just turn it vertical and I can get to it - and with the change in the operating system, it’s not such a big deal anymore. The entire package of the Case and my iPad fit great into my REI bag’s pocket, which seems designed for this specifically. So cool. The texture on the outside is nice - I hate slippery covers and the dangers of droppage.<br /><br />This keyboard is set up more like a traditional style keyboard. There’s a CAPS key, and fewer of the keys are tricky multi-use keys as in the earlier version I have. The keys also have a nice “pop” to them, and sound. They can keep up with me when I’m typing fast with my eyes closed or not (I can touch type). The keys do light up in several colors, but since (as I said) I can touch type, most of the time I don’t bother with the light. The lights can use up more of the battery and that means powering the unit up more often.<br /><br />Battery - no disappointments there. Powering up does seem slow, though, so depending on how much you use the board, you might want to plug it in at least once a week or every two weeks.<br /><br />Overall I’m finding this an excellent keyboard and case. I know there are reports about the hinge. I have not had difficulties with it, and I try not to abuse it by bending it backward too far. The hinge stays where I put it, which is nice. I have thought about buying a back-up Folio Case just in case. Maybe for Xmas. I write a lot, so I expect keyboards like this to wear out.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: while I like the keyboard itself, the case hinge broke after about three months or so. The right hinge tightened so much that it refused to move - there was something wrong with the design, or someone left out a key component in the hinge that would keep it from winding so tight.

A media consumption device with such a poor screen resolution.  I really thought I could live with it initially, and seemed like such a bargain.  What could go wrong?  In Amazon’s defense, nothing really.  Just - the more I used, the more hateful the device felt for me.  It works- just everything is a bit slow and not the best.  I realize the dirt cheap price is oh-so-attractive, and I love Amazon in general, and the device worked for what I did, but - just - ugh - not so well in any department.  After a month of using it, I just naturally stopped wanting to pick it up at all; still sitting on my night stand, not being used.  I kept just going back to using my phone.  Is a month’s use worth the cheap price?  Not for me.<br />I wish Amazon would make a more expensive/more premium product for people like me.",2.0,worked seemingly well enough for a month or so i like small tablets as well but yeah i grew really tired of the lagging and the awful screen a media consumption device with such a poor screen resolution i really thought i could live with it initially and seemed like such a bargain what could go wrong in amazons defense nothing really just the more i used the more hateful the device felt for me it works just everything is a bit slow and not the best i realize the dirt cheap price is ohsoattractive and i love amazon in general and the device worked for what i did but just ugh not so well in any department after a month of using it i just naturally stopped wanting to pick it up at all still sitting on my night stand not being used i kept just going back to using my phone is a months use worth the cheap price not for mebr i wish amazon would make a more expensivemore premium product for people like me,910
"I've been very unhappy with this wireless router. The broadcast distance on it is great - especially given it has no external antennas - but that alone doesn't make up for it's other issues.

I wouldn't mind this too much except that resets take forever, at least three or four times longer than other routers I've owned.<br /><br />The most annoying issue by far, though, is the constant IP conflict warnings I get on my devices.

"First off, I love ASUS for allowing custom firmware (still), but this router is a disappointment. I've had it for quite some time (2ish years?) and had problems with the Wi-Fi since day one. I used the stock firmware originally but the wifi sucked big time. Drops connection, has truely garbage speed a huge portion of the time, and to my knowledge is unfixable. After contacting tech support, they said my townhouse had too many other networks on the 2.4/5ghz bands. I thought that sounded reasonable because it was super crowded. However I moved a month ago and am having the SAME problem despite having only 1 other wifi network near enough to barely pick up. I've tried everything, and it just can't handle multiple devices being connected. I installed custom firmware hoping to fix the issue to no avail. If you buy this router, it has amazing hardwire speeds and loads of features, but expect to hard reset it daily to get a solid Wi-Fi signal for a short time. This is not capable of sending a stable connection for more than a day, so expect to have to switch your phone to mobile data at home and hardwire your computer and TV, and no the scheduled reset function does not make it work better, nor does disabling the features ASUS enabled be default.<br />The user interface is great, the customizability of almost every setting standard is really nice, but the wireless is a crap-shoot with no known fix.

"So I owned two of these cameras (argus eco).  They work okay - miss a lot of events but that was not the biggest problem.  I had both charging continuously with a solar panel.  For some reason I had to take them in at some point because they were not charging.  Reolink support recommended charging them indoors with the usb.  Each of the two times I did that, the charging port sunk so far into the camera that I could not connect it.  After dealing with this for a while with Reolink support, the bottom line was that since it was out of warranty, there was nothing they could do. By the way, one of these was a replacement camera they sent (for a different issued) that was only  6 months old but they do not count the warranty from that, they count it from the original purchase date.  So this happened on a camera that was only 6 months old as well as one that was a little over two years old.<br /><br />Since I could not charge the camera, it was not usable so I decided to take it apart to see what the issue was.  The pictures show that the connection port is thinly attached to a computer board.  The computer board is held in place (pushing the port up through the connection hole), simply with tape.  So the tape dried out and now slides down (see pictures), taking the port with it when you try to plug in.  This is a ridiculously simple problem to solve by the company.  They should simply screw in the board to the part that holds it in place.  So now I have two cameras that should work (well, one I destroyed by opening it up) but don't because there is no way to charge it.  Also, the soldering that connects the port to the board is also very weak.  It super easily broke off when trying to fish it out with tweezers.<br /><br />So, I might be stupid in that I ordered two more reolink outdoor cameras (a different type this time).  If the charging ports are built the same, I expect to have the same problem in the future.  Then this will truly be the last outdoor reolink camera that I will ever purchase.  The only reason I stuck with it is because it offers local storage.  I have no interest in paying for a subscription or having my images on a cloud...although I will likely reconsider that if these two new cameras fail as well.<br /><br />To those of you that have not yet run into this problem, maybe try to find a way to secure the porrt now, before you lose it to drying out tape.",2.0,so i owned two of these cameras argus eco they work okay miss a lot of events but that was not the biggest problem i had both charging continuously with a solar panel for some reason i had to take them in at some point because they were not charging reolink support recommended charging them indoors with the usb each of the two times i did that the charging port sunk so far into the camera that i could not connect it after dealing with this for a while with reolink support the bottom line was that since it was out of warranty there was nothing they could do by the way one of these was a replacement camera they sent for a different issued that was only months old but they do not count the warranty from that they count it from the original purchase date so this happened on a camera that was only months old as well as one that was a little over two years oldbr br since i could not charge the camera it was not usable so i decided to take it apart to see what the issue was the pictures show that the connection port is thinly attached to a computer board the computer board is held in place pushing the port up through the connection hole simply with tape so the tape dried out and now slides down see pictures taking the port with it when you try to plug in this is a ridiculously simple problem to solve by the company they should simply screw in the board to the part that holds it in place so now i have two cameras that should work well one i destroyed by opening it up but dont because there is no way to charge it also the soldering that connects the port to the board is also very weak it super easily broke off when trying to fish it out with tweezersbr br so i might be stupid in that i ordered two more reolink outdoor cameras a different type this time if the charging ports are built the same i expect to have the same problem in the future then this will truly be the last outdoor reolink camera that i will ever purchase the only reason i stuck with it is because it offers local storage i have no interest in paying for a subscription or having my images on a cloudalthough i will likely reconsider that if these two new cameras fail as wellbr br to those of you that have not yet run into this problem maybe try to find a way to secure the porrt now before you lose it to drying out tape,2313

"The idea behind this product is very good but the implementation is not so. First off, the tips of these pyramids are really pointy. If a child say falls on one these pyramids, he will be badly hurt to say the least. I shaved off the tips just in case.<br />As for the functionality, I installed the X10 transmitter in the kitchen and the X10 receiver in the living room, some 20ft apart, hoping to control my satellite equipment from the kitchen. The product works OK with one significant side effect: my remote control unit no longer works in the living room unless I hold it closer than 4 ft to the satellite equipment.<br />After some investigation, I found out that the reason is the X10 receiver is emitting continuous IR, and jamming the IR receivers on my satellite equipment. There is a visible (red) LED on the X10 receiver and 3 IR emitter LEDs. The idea is that the visible LED will also glow whenever IR is emitted. What's happening is that the X10 gets some RF interference and thinks that it should emit IR in response to it. The level of IR activity is so low that it does not trigger the visible LED, but it is high enough to confuse my satellite equipment. I was able to see all 3 IR LEDs on the X10 receiver firing constantly by observing the LEDs using a digital camera (digital cameras can enable you to see IR as it comes out of an IR emitter LED). I tried various measures to cut the interference, such as not extending the antenna, relocating the receiver, placing it in a grounded, metal box; nothing worked. Finally, I opened up the X10 receiver to see what else I can do inside it. Guess what, it is one of the most simplest and cheaply made receivers, with no protection whatsoever for RF interference. Furthermore, when you plug in the optional IR emitter cable into the X10 receiver, it acts as an antenna just to increase the RF interference.<br />To sum it up, the protocol between the X10 transmitter and the receiver is so poorly designed that an ordinary RF interference triggers the IR emission on the receiver. There are many ways for the manufacturer to make it a little more solid than this, even in analog domain (given the price of this product). But they prefer this simple RF on/off protocol (it's not even a protocol) to be able to use the lowest quality and the cheapest circuitry. Therefore, the product gets only 2 stars. You may be a little more lucky and see less or no RF interference in your location or your equipment's IR protocol may be more immune to this type of jamming. However, to be on the safe side, I suggest you look for a more solid repeater.",2.0,the idea behind this product is very good but the implementation is not so first off the tips of these pyramids are really pointy if a child say falls on one these pyramids he will be badly hurt to say the least i shaved off the tips just in casebr as for the functionality i installed the x transmitter in the kitchen and the x receiver in the living room some ft apart hoping to control my satellite equipment from the kitchen the product works ok with one significant side effect my remote control unit no longer works in the living room unless i hold it closer than ft to the satellite equipmentbr after some investigation i found out that the reason is the x receiver is emitting continuous ir and jamming the ir receivers on my satellite equipment there is a visible red led on the x receiver and ir emitter leds the idea is that the visible led will also glow whenever ir is emitted whats happening is that the x gets some rf interference and thinks that it should emit ir in response to it the level of ir activity is so low that it does not trigger the visible led but it is high enough to confuse my satellite equipment i was able to see all ir leds on the x receiver firing constantly by observing the leds using a digital camera digital cameras can enable you to see ir as it comes out of an ir emitter led i tried various measures to cut the interference such as not extending the antenna relocating the receiver placing it in a grounded metal box nothing worked finally i opened up the x receiver to see what else i can do inside it guess what it is one of the most simplest and cheaply made receivers with no protection whatsoever for rf interference furthermore when you plug in the optional ir emitter cable into the x receiver it acts as an antenna just to increase the rf interferencebr to sum it up the protocol between the x transmitter and the receiver is so poorly designed that an ordinary rf interference triggers the ir emission on the receiver there are many ways for the manufacturer to make it a little more solid than this even in analog domain given the price of this product but they prefer this simple rf onoff protocol its not even a protocol to be able to use the lowest quality and the cheapest circuitry therefore the product gets only stars you may be a little more lucky and see less or no rf interference in your location or your equipments ir protocol may be more immune to this type of jamming however to be on the safe side i suggest you look for a more solid repeater,2511

It's not at all color accurate, but it's ""OWN COLOR"" looks exceptional in most games. It's crisp and bright.<br />A monitor can have great color and yet be nowhere near color accurate. This is your typical example.<br />One other thing this monitor does exceptionally well is blacks. The blacks are deep, like my other two AMVA professional monitors.<br />HOWEVER!!!!!!!!<br />The deep black is plagued by light bleed and blooming.  If you put the monitor on bright, and drag an icon around you will see what I mean. Parts of the monitor illuminate especially down below the object.<br />My monitor came with no cables, and had two bright red stuck pixels in the middle of the screen.<br />This monitor should not be used for daily work, the curve is simply too extreme. It's all marketing garbage, this monitor would be much better should it be flat or have a slight curve. This curvature makes it have uneven light glows and uneven blacks, as well as whites. You move your head and you can see shifting. I did also try the dell 32"" but found this monitor to be more responsive in gaming. The dell too, was nowhere near color accurate. This also includes the smaller 27"" IPS.<br />I think the only gaming monitor I have not yet tried is the new LG nano, which came out a few weeks ago.<br />There is one monitor that I really did like, and that is the ASUS VG27AQL1A. This Asus is the closest gaming monitor I have found to 100% sRGB. Unfortunately, I need a 32"", 27"" looks too small next to my other monitors. Had this Odyssey monitor been color accurate, or near sRGB accurate, I may have considered keeping it. It really is so smooth in games. My GPU is only a 2070 super and I cannot quite reach 240fps in 1080p, but there's something about this monitor and gaming which I truly believe is different.<br /><br />Update 11/14<br />I can't believe the monitor stand Samsung have put on this monitor. You move your mouse rigorously whilst gaming and the whole monitor wobbles. You adjust something with the joystick and the whole thing wobbles out of control.  Unbelievable. Anyone would think it's Samsung's first attempt at making a monitor? If it's any consolation, this monitor is slightly better than the Dell, but it's also nearly twice the cost. I am going to do the following now. Secure a 3080 or Big Navi card, and wait for 32"" @ 4k next year. I may try the CX Oled 48"" just to satisfy my curiosity.",2.0,i did not buy directly from amazon but want to write a few linesbr in the past months i have purchased most gaming monitors i am trying to find a good or that rivals my professionals monitor colors srgb and is good for gamingbr my professional monitors although they have great color are not good for gaming they are older slower and only hzbr if you have to spend this monitor is exceptionally responsive its not at all color accurate but its own color looks exceptional in most games its crisp and brightbr a monitor can have great color and yet be nowhere near color accurate this is your typical examplebr one other thing this monitor does exceptionally well is blacks the blacks are deep like my other two amva professional monitorsbr howeverbr the deep black is plagued by light bleed and blooming if you put the monitor on bright and drag an icon around you will see what i mean parts of the monitor illuminate especially down below the objectbr my monitor came with no cables and had two bright red stuck pixels in the middle of the screenbr this monitor should not be used for daily work the curve is simply too extreme its all marketing garbage this monitor would be much better should it be flat or have a slight curve this curvature makes it have uneven light glows and uneven blacks as well as whites you move your head and you can see shifting i did also try the dell but found this monitor to be more responsive in gaming the dell too was nowhere near color accurate this also includes the smaller ipsbr i think the only gaming monitor i have not yet tried is the new lg nano which came out a few weeks agobr there is one monitor that i really did like and that is the asus vgaqla this asus is the closest gaming monitor i have found to srgb unfortunately i need a looks too small next to my other monitors had this odyssey monitor been color accurate or near srgb accurate i may have considered keeping it it really is so smooth in games my gpu is only a super and i cannot quite reach fps in p but theres something about this monitor and gaming which i truly believe is differentbr br update br i cant believe the monitor stand samsung have put on this monitor you move your mouse rigorously whilst gaming and the whole monitor wobbles you adjust something with the joystick and the whole thing wobbles out of control unbelievable anyone would think its samsungs first attempt at making a monitor if its any consolation this monitor is slightly better than the dell but its also nearly twice the cost i am going to do the following now secure a or big navi card and wait for k next year i may try the cx oled just to satisfy my curiosity,2654

I found the description of this item rather misleading. With a tagline like &#34;Extend your desktop and laptop to dual monitors with plug-and-play simplicity&#34; I would expect I would get two extended screens with a dual monitor setup. Instead all it provided was a single extended display *mirrored* on both external monitors. Disappointing.,2.0,i found the description of this item rather misleading with a tagline like extend your desktop and laptop to dual monitors with plugandplay simplicity i would expect i would get two extended screens with a dual monitor setup instead all it provided was a single extended display mirrored on both external monitors disappointing,327

"Our 29 lb, 47 inch TV was apparently too much for this mount. After installing (correctly - to a wall stud) and attaching the TV, I became immediately concerned due to the amount of &#34;play&#34; in both the swing arm and the TV, itself.  The swing arm was bouncy, moving maybe 1/4 inch up and down. And despite (again, correctly) tightening the leveling screws the screen could rotate a bit.  It shouldn't move at all...  I should have known that a $22 mount wouldn't be anything but cheap.",2.0,our lb inch tv was apparently too much for this mount after installing correctly to a wall stud and attaching the tv i became immediately concerned due to the amount of play in both the swing arm and the tv itself the swing arm was bouncy moving maybe inch up and down and despite again correctly tightening the leveling screws the screen could rotate a bit it shouldnt move at all i should have known that a mount wouldnt be anything but cheap,444

"This is a pretty cover but it does not fit the iPad Pro12 inch very well. More purple then the blue pictured. The pencil holder is on the wrong side to charge it so you have to make a point to put your tablet someplace safe to charge the pencil. Although there is a magnetic section on the other side to charge the pencil, the pencil falls off. I would not buy this again.",2.0,this is a pretty cover but it does not fit the ipad pro inch very well more purple then the blue pictured the pencil holder is on the wrong side to charge it so you have to make a point to put your tablet someplace safe to charge the pencil although there is a magnetic section on the other side to charge the pencil the pencil falls off i would not buy this again,364
"I bought this armband for my Motorola Droid when I am running. It might be OK if you have small arms and don't sweat, but I am a man with large arms and I DO sweat, so I found it useless. First of all, it was difficult to get the phone into it. It allows sweat into the pocket with the phone, so it's not very sweatproof. The velcro also continuously comes undone, making it utterly useless. I definitely would not recommend it.",2.0,i bought this armband for my motorola droid when i am running it might be ok if you have small arms and dont sweat but i am a man with large arms and i do sweat so i found it useless first of all it was difficult to get the phone into it it allows sweat into the pocket with the phone so its not very sweatproof the velcro also continuously comes undone making it utterly useless i definitely would not recommend it,415
