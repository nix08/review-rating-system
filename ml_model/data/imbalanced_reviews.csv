"Owning a DSLR is all about using the right lens for the occasion, but sometimes a do-it-all lens makes travel or photo walks easier. While it is true the lens is soft wide open and at both ends of the zoom, stopping down fixes almost all of that. Also, barrel distortion is noticeable, but now that Light Room 4 has this lens in the library, fixing it in post is straight forward. In the end, it is about the pictures you can take, and I have been more than happy with all the shots I have taken so far.<br />Note, some reviewers have complained of the weight. I shoot this on D7000, and the balance is good. I have the 70-200 f2.8 nikkor lens, and it is much lighter than that.<br />Also, the zoom on this lens is nice and tight. No drift in the zoom, and it feels good zooming in and out. The lens focuses quickly and sharp.<br />The only negative for the lens is obvious from stats. Low light shooting is only ok, especially zoomed in. The VR helps, as do the better bodies that shoot well at high ISO.",5.0,owning a dslr is all about using the right lens for the occasion but sometimes a doitall lens makes travel or photo walks easier while it is true the lens is soft wide open and at both ends of the zoom stopping down fixes almost all of that also barrel distortion is noticeable but now that light room has this lens in the library fixing it in post is straight forward in the end it is about the pictures you can take and i have been more than happy with all the shots i have taken so farbr note some reviewers have complained of the weight i shoot this on d and the balance is good i have the f nikkor lens and it is much lighter than thatbr also the zoom on this lens is nice and tight no drift in the zoom and it feels good zooming in and out the lens focuses quickly and sharpbr the only negative for the lens is obvious from stats low light shooting is only ok especially zoomed in the vr helps as do the better bodies that shoot well at high iso,951

"I've been an avid fan of ebooks since the long gone days of the Rocket and the eBookman, and a fan of the Kindle since the very beginning.  This is miles and away the best there has ever been.  It is a luxury model, no doubt, but oh is it luxurious.<br /><br />I like:<br />The weight.  Even in the case it's very light, though if it gets much lighter I'll worry about it blowing away in a strong wind.<br />The size.  It's not going to get much smaller without shrinking the screen.<br />The interface.  I'm sorry, I like buttons.  Call me old.  I never bent back the spine of a book (horrors) so I can't compare the feel of this to that, but I can say it's nice for a long reading session.  The touch screen takes a bit of getting used to, but the tutorial will guide a new user. The tutorial is intrusive at first, but provides useful information and goes away quickly.  I will suggest customizing the screen.  I hated the default, but you get a lot of options to make it just the way you want.<br />The lighting is now all but invisible.  I was unhappy that you can't completely turn it off as you could with the Nook Glowlight, and turning it down casts an odd yellow light over the page, but it's so even now as to be so unintrusive I barely notice going from sunlight to tunnel on the bus home. With the Nook I'd be thrown out of the book to go turn on the light.  With the Kindle, I can keep reading without a pause.  It does not have adaptive lighting, but I'm not sure it needs it.<br />The download speed.  I don't know if it's supposed to be faster than the Kindle Keyboard (the last one I had with 3G) but it certainly seems that way.<br />The battery life.  Maybe with this thing going for months we'll finally hear an end to the &#34;but my dead tree doesn't run out of power&#34; nonsense.<br />Next in series. When you're almost done with a book, it tells you where the story continues.  Now the next feature I want, and if it does this I haven't seen it yet, is an alert when the next book in a series I'm following is published.  Yes, FictFact is great, but I'm greedy and want it right on the device.<br /><br />I don't like:<br />It's not waterproof.  There was a lot of hope it would be after the Nook went that route.<br />It's not solar, yet, but there are rumors of a solar cover coming soon.<br />It doesn't support Audible and the excellent immersive reading between ebook and audiobook.  I have a weird love of that feature, seeing what changed print to audio.<br />Recommended Content and Reading Lists.  I shut this feature off.  The information seems scattered at best and gave me no useful information, especially considering how precious screen real estate is.",5.0,ive been an avid fan of ebooks since the long gone days of the rocket and the ebookman and a fan of the kindle since the very beginning this is miles and away the best there has ever been it is a luxury model no doubt but oh is it luxuriousbr br i likebr the weight even in the case its very light though if it gets much lighter ill worry about it blowing away in a strong windbr the size its not going to get much smaller without shrinking the screenbr the interface im sorry i like buttons call me old i never bent back the spine of a book horrors so i cant compare the feel of this to that but i can say its nice for a long reading session the touch screen takes a bit of getting used to but the tutorial will guide a new user the tutorial is intrusive at first but provides useful information and goes away quickly i will suggest customizing the screen i hated the default but you get a lot of options to make it just the way you wantbr the lighting is now all but invisible i was unhappy that you cant completely turn it off as you could with the nook glowlight and turning it down casts an odd yellow light over the page but its so even now as to be so unintrusive i barely notice going from sunlight to tunnel on the bus home with the nook id be thrown out of the book to go turn on the light with the kindle i can keep reading without a pause it does not have adaptive lighting but im not sure it needs itbr the download speed i dont know if its supposed to be faster than the kindle keyboard the last one i had with g but it certainly seems that waybr the battery life maybe with this thing going for months well finally hear an end to the but my dead tree doesnt run out of power nonsensebr next in series when youre almost done with a book it tells you where the story continues now the next feature i want and if it does this i havent seen it yet is an alert when the next book in a series im following is published yes fictfact is great but im greedy and want it right on the devicebr br i dont likebr its not waterproof there was a lot of hope it would be after the nook went that routebr its not solar yet but there are rumors of a solar cover coming soonbr it doesnt support audible and the excellent immersive reading between ebook and audiobook i have a weird love of that feature seeing what changed print to audiobr recommended content and reading lists i shut this feature off the information seems scattered at best and gave me no useful information especially considering how precious screen real estate is,2529

"This Winegard antenna is worth the extra money for the pre-amplifier. Previously I had tried a different flat antenna, which was actually worst than the homemade wire di-pole I had previously strung along the edge of the ceiling. (The wire had to go because it didn't meet the wife acceptance factor ;).<br /><br />I'm a radio engineer by profession, so my gut feel from the beginning was that the pre-amp would be better, but I thought an unamplified passive antenna would be good enough. I was wrong. This Winegard amplified antenna picks up more signals than I've seen at my house before, and the tv-tuner scan completed much faster, suggesting it was able to decode the channels easier due to much better signal-to-noise ratio.<br /><br />Your television or digital tv tuner box has an amplifier in the back, but even if it included the best amplifier available (which it doesn't), you still can't get back all the signal that was lost in the coaxial cable run from the antenna to the tv. That's why it's important to amplify the signal as close to the source as possible, which is what this antenna does by sticking the amplifier in the plastic box on the base of the antenna itself. (The small plastic dongle toward the TV end of the cable is just a bias circuit to send power to the amplifier at the antenna end of the cable.)<br /><br />I'm comparing this Winegard antenna to the http://www.amazon.com/Mohu-Leaf-Paper-Thin-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B00HSMK580, which I purchased first and was not happy with. Even after moving it around, I still couldn't get even nearby VHF channels, which are most of what we're interested in. Too bad I already threw away the packaging and cannot return it.<br /><br />If you're farther from the station you're trying to watch, even this amplified indoor antenna may not work for you, and you'll have to get a larger attic or roof-mounted antenna. A site like tvfool dot com can tell you the signal levels and bearing of all the stations visible in your area, and tell you if they're strong enough for an indoor antenna.",5.0,this winegard antenna is worth the extra money for the preamplifier previously i had tried a different flat antenna which was actually worst than the homemade wire dipole i had previously strung along the edge of the ceiling the wire had to go because it didnt meet the wife acceptance factor br br im a radio engineer by profession so my gut feel from the beginning was that the preamp would be better but i thought an unamplified passive antenna would be good enough i was wrong this winegard amplified antenna picks up more signals than ive seen at my house before and the tvtuner scan completed much faster suggesting it was able to decode the channels easier due to much better signaltonoise ratiobr br your television or digital tv tuner box has an amplifier in the back but even if it included the best amplifier available which it doesnt you still cant get back all the signal that was lost in the coaxial cable run from the antenna to the tv thats why its important to amplify the signal as close to the source as possible which is what this antenna does by sticking the amplifier in the plastic box on the base of the antenna itself the small plastic dongle toward the tv end of the cable is just a bias circuit to send power to the amplifier at the antenna end of the cablebr br im comparing this winegard antenna to the which i purchased first and was not happy with even after moving it around i still couldnt get even nearby vhf channels which are most of what were interested in too bad i already threw away the packaging and cannot return itbr br if youre farther from the station youre trying to watch even this amplified indoor antenna may not work for you and youll have to get a larger attic or roofmounted antenna a site like tvfool dot com can tell you the signal levels and bearing of all the stations visible in your area and tell you if theyre strong enough for an indoor antenna,1904

"We set this up in a studio apartment, which worked well since the TV, laptop, router and the speaker were all relatively close to each other.  First, we connected the sounder to the television audio output using the optical cable.  Then, I used bluetooth to connect the speaker to my iPhone and listen to audiobooks on OverDrive as well as music using Pandora.  I set it up on my mother's phone as well and taught her how to connect her iPhone to the speaker so that she can listen to podcasts, audiobooks and music on her own.<br /><br />We appreciate that the speaker is a big step up from the audio on our tv and the smaller speakers that we'd previously used. The different sounds are clear and when used for audiobooks, the voices are clear without having to raise the volume too high.  The speaker works very well for our purposes and didn't require a professional (or my audiophile brother) to set it up.",5.0,we set this up in a studio apartment which worked well since the tv laptop router and the speaker were all relatively close to each other first we connected the sounder to the television audio output using the optical cable then i used bluetooth to connect the speaker to my iphone and listen to audiobooks on overdrive as well as music using pandora i set it up on my mothers phone as well and taught her how to connect her iphone to the speaker so that she can listen to podcasts audiobooks and music on her ownbr br we appreciate that the speaker is a big step up from the audio on our tv and the smaller speakers that wed previously used the different sounds are clear and when used for audiobooks the voices are clear without having to raise the volume too high the speaker works very well for our purposes and didnt require a professional or my audiophile brother to set it up,882

"Currently Jan 2021.  Bought these in Dec 2019.<br />A couple of months ago the left earbud stopped working.  Not surprising because I USE THESE THINGS LIKE CRAZY.<br />Rain, wind, workouts, and more.  Almost every day.<br />Why do I use them every day?

I even bought some other brands of the comparable price range, but I sent them back because they just didn't compare.  I thought it might be worth a shot in the dark and I reached out to ANKER customer service.<br />They gave me a few steps to follow to attempt to remedy the issue, and when it didn't work, I was informed they actually have a 18 MONTH WARRANTY!<br /><br />Once I showed proof of my purchase (sidenote: Take a pic of the charge cable with SN when you receive them), A new (not refurb)... NEW PAIR was shipped to me in short order.<br /><br />I'm back to my favorite earbuds again!

"I have a good tangle of cables in my home office for a variety of devices that require a micro-USB cable. Most of these cables are very nondescript and I have no idea who made them, though there are a couple of them that have manufacturer names printed on the plugs on the end. Most are plain black and are mostly indistinguishable from one another. These cables from Magic-T are absolutely the most easily identifiable cables on the desk and it has made it very easy to assign cables to every device on the desk. But, there is more to these cables than just pretty colors.<br /><br />The most obvious advantage of this cable set is the colors. Each of these cables is a different color and none of them are black or gray - there’s blue, pink, orange and green. And, even more important than the color is the fact that they are insulated in nylon weave, not plastic coating, which in my experience holds up a bit better under stress and the result is a more reliable cable.<br /><br />The plugs on both ends are metal shielding with a plastic base, sufficient to give these strength for the connections. The cables have been inserted in the bases and attached within, not attached to the plug base, but those connections are very tight and seem to be solid so I am not concerned about them pulling loose.<br /><br />Each cable is about six and a half feet in length which is much more convenient for me than the regular 3' cables.<br /><br />These cables are capable of high-speed charging so if you have a device and a charger that are both capable of high-speed charging then these cables will work well for you. I used one for my tablet and a high-speed USB charger and the tablet did charge faster than when using a lower-grade cable.<br /><br />I want to mention the pricing. As I write this, the price on this set of four cables is about $9. That’s about $2.25 per cable, and the cables are of good quality. The price can change of course, but at the current price this is an absolute bargain.<br /><br />There’s something else I need to mention. The manufacturer offers a 12-month warranty on these cables, and to me that’s just amazing. For a cable that costs less than $2.50 per individual cable the manufacturer thinks enough of their product to back it with a 12-month warranty. I doubt I would ever need to use the warranty for one of these, but it’s reassuring to know the manufacturer believes in their products.<br /><br />It is hard to find fault with these cables. They are made well, they are easily identifiable and they are very inexpensive. This is a fine set at a great price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",5.0,i have a good tangle of cables in my home office for a variety of devices that require a microusb cable most of these cables are very nondescript and i have no idea who made them though there are a couple of them that have manufacturer names printed on the plugs on the end most are plain black and are mostly indistinguishable from one another these cables from magict are absolutely the most easily identifiable cables on the desk and it has made it very easy to assign cables to every device on the desk but there is more to these cables than just pretty colorsbr br the most obvious advantage of this cable set is the colors each of these cables is a different color and none of them are black or gray theres blue pink orange and green and even more important than the color is the fact that they are insulated in nylon weave not plastic coating which in my experience holds up a bit better under stress and the result is a more reliable cablebr br the plugs on both ends are metal shielding with a plastic base sufficient to give these strength for the connections the cables have been inserted in the bases and attached within not attached to the plug base but those connections are very tight and seem to be solid so i am not concerned about them pulling loosebr br each cable is about six and a half feet in length which is much more convenient for me than the regular cablesbr br these cables are capable of highspeed charging so if you have a device and a charger that are both capable of highspeed charging then these cables will work well for you i used one for my tablet and a highspeed usb charger and the tablet did charge faster than when using a lowergrade cablebr br i want to mention the pricing as i write this the price on this set of four cables is about thats about per cable and the cables are of good quality the price can change of course but at the current price this is an absolute bargainbr br theres something else i need to mention the manufacturer offers a month warranty on these cables and to me thats just amazing for a cable that costs less than per individual cable the manufacturer thinks enough of their product to back it with a month warranty i doubt i would ever need to use the warranty for one of these but its reassuring to know the manufacturer believes in their productsbr br it is hard to find fault with these cables they are made well they are easily identifiable and they are very inexpensive this is a fine set at a great pricebr br disclaimer i was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair honest and thorough review even though i received this product at no cost i have rated and reviewed this product without bias based solely on my experience with it,2722

"I purchased this Panasonic Soundbar in June of 2013.  At the time, my requirements were:<br /> - Good sound (can't afford GREAT sound)<br /> - Wireless Subwoofer<br /> - HDMI input and good HDMI-CEC support<br /> - Bluetooth support<br /><br />In my search, I tested the [[ASIN:B00811NMMI Toshiba SBX4250]] and the [[ASIN:B00BLX9510 Samsung HW-F450]] from my local Costco.  My final choice was the Panasonic.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> - Acceptable sound -- The front speakers are not a big improvement over the built-ins.  With the subwoofer turned off, it is easy to mistake the Panasonic sound bar with the speakers from the Television.<br /> - Good subwoofer -- The sub sounds good even at high volumes and fills out the overall sound from the sound bar.<br /> - The Samsung has clearer mid and high ranges so the Panasonic seems slightly muffled in comparison.<br /> - Overall sound better than the Toshiba.<br /> - Wireless range for the subwoofer is short -- especially if placed behind the sofa (interference from people sitting in front of it).  Range is about 15 feet with clear line of sight.<br /><br />Decoders and Passthrough:<br /> - AC3 and DTS Decoder (Toshiba lacks DTS)<br />- ARC (Audio Return Channel) -- If you use the Netflix app built in to your TV, audio is generated by your TV.  Normally, an ""optical out"" cable from the TV back to the sound bar is necessary.  ARC removes that need.<br /><br />HDMI-CEC (also Aquos Link, Anynet+, Bravia LinkSync, Regza Link, etc):<br />This is where the Panasonic beats the Samsung.  HDMI-CEC allows Televisions to control a connected device -- no matter the brand;  The TV remote should be able to turn on a bluray player and send navigation (up/down/etc) and standard playback buttons without the need for a second remote control.<br /><br />In the case of a sound bar, through HDMI-CEC:<br /> 1. The sound bar should turn on when the TV turns on -- Panasonic does this, Samsung does not.<br /> 2. The TV should play all sound through the sound bar and volume buttons on the TV remote should control volume on the sound bar -- Panasonic does this.<br /> 3. Turning on a bluray player, the sound bar should turn on and switch to the correct input automatically.  The TV should also turn on and switch to the correct input -- Panasonic does this.  It's then up to your TV do its part.<br /><br />In conclusion, I chose the Panasonic because it gave me the ability to eliminate a remote control through HDMI-CEC (which Samsung didn't) and it had both AC3 and DTS decoders (which Toshiba didn't).  With the added ability to play music from my phone through bluetooth, I'm still happy with my purchase one year later.<br /><br />Tip:  Unlike the Samsung and Toshiba, the Panasonic has a small ""receiver"" unit that adds another machine to your entertainment center.  For me, I use some velcro strips and attach the ""receiver"" to the back of my TV.  It is only 1 ¾"" thick which was thinner than my wall mount.",5.0,i purchased this panasonic soundbar in june of at the time my requirements werebr good sound cant afford great soundbr wireless subwooferbr hdmi input and good hdmicec supportbr bluetooth supportbr br in my search i tested the asinbnmmi toshiba sbx and the asinbblx samsung hwf from my local costco my final choice was the panasonicbr br soundbr acceptable sound the front speakers are not a big improvement over the builtins with the subwoofer turned off it is easy to mistake the panasonic sound bar with the speakers from the televisionbr good subwoofer the sub sounds good even at high volumes and fills out the overall sound from the sound barbr the samsung has clearer mid and high ranges so the panasonic seems slightly muffled in comparisonbr overall sound better than the toshibabr wireless range for the subwoofer is short especially if placed behind the sofa interference from people sitting in front of it range is about feet with clear line of sightbr br decoders and passthroughbr ac and dts decoder toshiba lacks dtsbr arc audio return channel if you use the netflix app built in to your tv audio is generated by your tv normally an optical out cable from the tv back to the sound bar is necessary arc removes that needbr br hdmicec also aquos link anynet bravia linksync regza link etcbr this is where the panasonic beats the samsung hdmicec allows televisions to control a connected device no matter the brand the tv remote should be able to turn on a bluray player and send navigation updownetc and standard playback buttons without the need for a second remote controlbr br in the case of a sound bar through hdmicecbr the sound bar should turn on when the tv turns on panasonic does this samsung does notbr the tv should play all sound through the sound bar and volume buttons on the tv remote should control volume on the sound bar panasonic does thisbr turning on a bluray player the sound bar should turn on and switch to the correct input automatically the tv should also turn on and switch to the correct input panasonic does this its then up to your tv do its partbr br in conclusion i chose the panasonic because it gave me the ability to eliminate a remote control through hdmicec which samsung didnt and it had both ac and dts decoders which toshiba didnt with the added ability to play music from my phone through bluetooth im still happy with my purchase one year laterbr br tip unlike the samsung and toshiba the panasonic has a small receiver unit that adds another machine to your entertainment center for me i use some velcro strips and attach the receiver to the back of my tv it is only thick which was thinner than my wall mount,2666

"Wow, I LOVE this!  I didn't even know iPhone keyboards existed until I happened to see one (another brand) at Best Buy.  I can't say how many times I've wanted to respond to an email or text on my phone, but waited until I got to a computer so I could type fast instead of picking it out key by key (I'm old lol).  This seemed the perfect solution.  I had a hard time deciding which one to get, as there are very similar ones, but for some reason felt most confident ordering this one.  The magnetic case is nice looking and sturdy, and when folded around the keyboard, looks kind of  like a diary.  But open it up and there is the keyboard, folded into thirds.  As soon as you unfold it to use, it instantly comes on!  Paired immediately with my smartphone.  As long as you have a flat surface you are set.

Took me a minute or two until I figured out the bag-like item was the soft flash diffuser.

I do sports photos as a volunteer for our church, and needed something with more horsepower than the built-in flash from the Canon T2i I use for the photos.

With the SSD it boots in 16 seconds.  The Hard drive is Extremely easy to access.  Two screws on the back of the laptop then d/c the Hard drive and plop in your SSD.  The mouse buttons are annoyingly loud.  The battery lasts a long time.  It dropped 10% over an hour while I was viewing power-point slides for class.  Over all I couldn't be happier.

"I buy cases for my tablets before I use them so I don't have an accident. I knew I wanted something like this as I have a similar case on my Samsung.<br />  I'm thrilled to see cases with patterns! I chose this seller for these reasons: 1. Price for what you are getting. 2. Screen protector included. 3. Prime shipping. 4. Seller ratings.<br />  I ordered Fri and received this on Sun. Great, fast shipping! Packaged nicely, not over or under packed. I put the screen protector on first. Fits perfectly, holes in the protector for both the camera and the home button.<br />  Next, take the three pieces of the case apart, gently! The hard pieces must be pried apart with care, I was afraid I could crack them so I did it slowly. If you don't have patience, ask a friend to do this. Place your iPad between the two hard plastic pieces than snap these two pieces back together. (No instructions) Be sure all the way around is closed without gaps or it isn't completely closed and could come apart if it was dropped. Once all edges are closed, slip the soft silicone back cover on. This silicone will fit very nicely into cut outs all around the edges. There is a flap where the plug goes in the bottom of the iPad as well as the headphone jack.<br />  Yes, this all adds weight to your iPad but I prefer the weight to the security of knowing if I drop this, most likely nothing will get busted!

"See my test in the image above.<br />This test was done on a PC under W-XP Pro.<br /><br />B4 you get going: CHARGE your RECEIVER (attach USB to unit and your computer; included).  SOFTWARE INSTALLATION and personal configuration.  INSTALL BATTERIES in the pen.  INSTALL the PEN CARTIDGE.  PEN CAP helps you push the cartridge in; didn't need it but you will to remove the cartridge.  All was EZ and fast.<br /><br />CONFIGUATION COMMENTS:  I first set the pen up for a lefty using the BLOCK OF PAPER (you would position RECEIVER at right of your paper).  That didn't work; my notes were on an angle.  Changed to position receiver to the SINGLE PAPER option (position receiver in center of page.  Much better!<br /><br />Proceeded with my test.  With little to no learning curve, this pen did exactly what IOGear says it will do.  It showed my handwritten test on the screen (software must be open).  Saving took me a few minutes to understand.  Still learning about the options.<br /><br />I then asked the software to convert my written test to TEXT.  My handwriting is not bad, but it isn't great either.  First shot out of the barn and it was right on!  The result is above in the image.<br /><br />Next, I asked it to save my written test as a STICKY NOTE and I dragged the note on to me desktop.  Bling!  Amazing again.  But when I toggled over to Outlook, the note disappeared ... have to learn more about this.<br /><br />Then, I asked it to save as a PAPER HOLDER (?) and dragged it to my Outlook screen.  Cha-ching!  There it went and it stayed on top in Outlook this time.  I toggled over to my Explorer window and Bling!  It was still right on top.  My heart is beating with excitement for this new toy!!!<br /><br />> You must have the software open to see your notes on screen.  Ditto for keeping the STICKY NOTES or PAPER HOLDERS on top of a program.  Not so for on-the-road.  It will store your notes in the receiver's memory.  I have to learn more ... remember, it's only an hour old!<br /><br />RECEIVER has a MULTI-FUNCTION BUTTON to toggle between using the pen as a MOUSE and NOTE TAKER.  Default is a mouse.  To use the NOTE TAKER feature just push the button on the RECEIVER.  You will see an icon on the RECEIVER SCREEN that tells you what mode you are in.  First test as a MOUSE told me I'm too fast on the mouse to make this a good mouse toy. IOGear says, if using as a mouse, you are best SWITCHING THE PEN CARTRIDGE TO A STYLUS CARTRIDGE.  COMMENT:  Switching the pen cartridge will likely be a pain and not worthwhile unless you plan more mouse activity than note taking.<br />> update:  It comes with a stylus.  Fell out of the package when I opened it.  Found later; it's black, small and thin. Take care when you open the pen cartridge bag.<br /><br />PEN has a BUTTON on it; located by your forefinger.  Button functions as a SINGLE MOUSE CLICK; maybe more ... have to read more instructions.<br />ABOUT THIS ITEM:<br />- PEN SIZE is as a typical pen (not fat or clumsy).<br />- RECEIVER is small and light; I hope I don't lose it on the road.<br />- NOTE-TAKING does not require USB attach to your computer; it has a memory for your download later.<br />- PACKAGE comes with everything you need; INCLUDES USB, the PEN, PEN BATTERIES, PEN CARTRIDGE, STYLUS CARTRIDGE, OPERATION SOFTWARE and TEXT CONVERSION SOFTWARE.<br /><br />Not sure what the reviewer means who talks about needing a cardboard support for the RECEIVER.  I attached the RECEIVER to a few pages in my 1/2"" thick spiral bound notebook.  Attached comfortably to the top 3 pages with no problems.<br /><br />If you take notes and don't want to spend time looking for them 2 days later, or want to keep a permanent record, this is a must have!<br />I'll be back if anything changes.  For now, its a full 5 stars.<br /><br />I was not able to find any of these products at Retail to touch and feel.

"If you're looking for an affordable OTA antenna, then you've probably seen A LOT of them over the course of your research. I went back & forth on a few, but finally pulled the trigger & went with this unit. And I'm glad I did! After using for almost one month, it has exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />The unit came well packed from the vendor with all of the parts needed for the installation. You will need a few tools for the mounting portion of your install, but these will be determined by where you mount (indoors or outdoors). The manual will explain further. The documentation is OK (not great), but you will be able to complete the project from what is provided.<br /><br />This kit ships with a mounting pole, 40' RG6 coax, a rotor control (to remotely turn the antenna), a pre-amp, the antenna & mounting hardware. Some light assembly is required, but it's very straightforward.<br /><br />**There is a model of this antenna that is cheaper, but DOES NOT SHIP with a mounting pole. So make sure you select the correct version for your application.**<br /><br />Also, some OTA antennas DO NOT included coax, a mounting pole or a pre-amp. These will be additional expenses on top of the purchase of your antenna. So make sure you read the details on any antenna that you consider purchasing. This model includes all of these items.<br /><br />Of course, for the price, you're not receiving a top of the line pre-amp, or for that matter high quality RG6, but for most applications it should suffice just fine. Especially if you install indoors (mine was an attic install) where it will be protected from the elements.<br /><br />And for anyone wondering, the pre-amp IS powered by the rotor control box (not by the coax feed). So if you opt not to use the rotor (to turn the antenna on demand) then you will not be able to use the pre-amp.<br /><br />So if you need the pre-amp, you will have to connect up the rotor control even if it won't be used. However, if neither are needed, then they can be bypassed entirely.<br /><br />Also, you can run this antenna directly into a signal booster (drop amplifier) like a PCT (PCT-VC-9U). These can be found on Amazon for around $50.00 - $100.00 depending on size & features you need. So if you already have coax jacks in your house that are in place from previous cable or satellite TV, then you can repurpose those jacks for your new antenna. This way you can distribute your antenna signal to all (or most) of the TV's in your house!<br /><br />Please note that your location, proximity to your broadcast towers, potential points of interference (trees, building, mountains, etc..) & height of your mount are a HUGE DEAL when using ANY OTA antenna.<br /><br />I'm located in FL, so it's pretty flat. However, most of the broadcast towers are 30-45 miles away.  As well, the antenna was mounted indoors & at the most 15' to 16' in the air. So it is fairly low. However, even with an indoor installation (and not using the pre-amp) , this antenna easily picked up 57 OTA channels!<br /><br />So while some people blame the antenna when they can only pick up a few stations, there are many other moving parts involved to get this all to work.<br /><br />If this is your first time installing an OTA antenna, then PLEASE use a free site like ""tvfool"" or ""antennaweb"" (Google these) to determine what direction your broadcast towers are in relation to where you will be mounting your antenna. These services will also tell you what channels are going to be achievable with the antenna of your choosing. All you do is plug in your address & the site will serve up all of the info that you need. Do this BEFORE you buy any antenna to make sure it's even worth your time.<br /><br />One last thing, be sure to re-scan your channels on your TV every now & again. Channels get repacked (put under different channel assignments) & new channels get added. So if a channel that was coming in suddenly disappears, it may not be your antenna, but the broadcast signal itself.<br /><br />Overall, this antenna was easy to install. Since I mounted indoors, I used two 2"" wood screws with washers right into a truss to mount the mast. The antenna goes on with 2 bolts (ratchet & socket do well here) & you're done. I can't personally speak to an outdoor installation, but would have to assume that it would be a bit more involved.<br /><br />I shortened the included RG6 cable (only dual shield not quad shield) to around 15' as my equipment panel was directly below the antenna in the laundry room. If you decide to do this, then you will need to crimp on a new compression connector on one end of the cable. However, you can purchase an entire kit on Amazon (with F connectors, coax stripper & the crimp tool) for under $20.00 (Bestar #3189 (Blue-F) ). It's VERY easy. You can do it!<br /><br />As well, having a shorter run can only help your signal performance. So if you have excess cable after your install, consider shortening it to the exact length that you need.<br /><br />The hardest part of the install is dialing in the perfect sweet spot for your broadcast towers. The best thing you can do is use the websites noted above to get the direction of the towers BEFORE you do your install. Then bring a compass (yes, a real compass) or use a compass on your smartphone (this is what I did & it worked perfectly) to help point your antenna in the correct direction. If you have a helper, then have them scan the channels once you lock on to your desired direction. It may take a few attempts, but it's worth it (especially if you don't use the rotor function). Cell phones or walkie talkies do nicely here :-)<br /><br />And if you ever need it, their support was great. It's only email based, but they responded within 24 hrs. Very willing to help & get any questions answered.<br /><br />If things change, I will update this review. However, after almost a month of use, I've been very happy with this kit. It feels great not paying the cable company to provide stations that are otherwise floating around us for free -in uncompressed HD!",5.0,if youre looking for an affordable ota antenna then youve

"I have used and tested more Ethernet cables than I can remember and there is no question, all Ethernet cables are not created equally.<br /><br />Typically any device requiring an Ethernet cable will come with one in the packaging - it will work (usually).  A good comparison is those cables are much like an old car - it should get you there, whereas this cable is like a high end sports car - it will get you there lightning fast, without fail.<br /><br />This Cat8 is extra thick due to the shielding within and the additional insulation.  The connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug.  The connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivity.<br /><br />This Cat8 Ethernet Cable is 30’ long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your TV or gaming system into your router.  So many of us stream programs and movies via our TV and there is no comparison in speed between a WiFi connection and a wired connection.  For gamers, it is absolutely the way to go - do away with all lag caused by your WiFi by connecting directly to your router.<br /><br />You will not find a better 30’ Ethernet Cable - this is really a top of the line cable that you’ll love.  This is a purchase that you’ll never regret.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

"I've been having a really hard time finding earbuds for my really small ears. I hate my ears and it has been a struggle for the last 10 years. My first legitimate pair were the Bose Soundsport. They were great at first but absolutely hated the fact they stuck out so far. I ended up selling them.<br /><br />Then I saw these. They are under $200 and I was like screw it, I'm going to get them. They are a great fit. Unfortunately I cannot wear them for long periods of time due to my small, shitty ears that God has blessed me with.

The battery life of the charging case is great too. I didn't have to charge the buds for a month (fyi I only use these while working out and keep at a low volume). The noise cancelling is awesome.

I wanted to try some without paying a premium price, so this seemed like a good starter set.<br /><br />These guys are just flat fun to play with!

"Where have I been that I did not know about this brand and its head-rockin quality? First, let's start off with the innocuous vintage design. It looks like something that might be on diner countertop from the 50's but when you turn that baby on and UP? Space age indeed. True audiophiles will love the ability to tweak the settings exactly to their liking and pairing and app setup takes all of minutes. This speaker is not only a wonderful conversation piece, it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Speaking of conversations, let's move on to Alexa. This is native to this new edition and all you have to do is sign in and and off you go! Given the recently curious publicity about Alexa cackling into the night or calling folks and snitching (LOL), I was rather wary about this feature but quickly grew on me when I saw not only how easy it is to use, but how QUICKLY you can turn it off. There are lights that indicate whether or not this feature is enabled, thank goodness!<br /><br />This is such a remarkable speaker. It fits just about anywhere yet delivers a sound that will rattle the walls.

"This TV arrived yesterday, fast shipping UPS, box in great shape, well packed and no damage.  Ordered this for a bedroom and already have a TV in our living room with a Fire TV box.  No problem setting up or connecting to Wifi and our router is on a different floor.  Be sure to have your passwords handy, the layout mirrored our other TV, but you will need to download apps like Netflix and Hulu.  TV works great, color and sound are fantastic.  What took me to most time was to link the TV to my echo device so I included directions below.  I discovered you cannot turn the TV on hands-free using the echo unless you refer to the TV as ""Fire TV"", not just ""TV"".  Example ""Alexa, turn on Fire TV"".  The only small negative I have is the red light at the bottom of the TV stays on when the TV is turned off.  Not a big deal except at night in a bedroom if you have a sensitivity to lights when you're sleeping.  I'm just going to put electrical tape over it.<br /><br />We wall mounted ours using the Mounting Dream 26-55 Inch TVs, Full Motion TV Wall Mount MD2413-MX.

"I have had a Kindle for several years and primarily used it for reading or playing games I could browse the internet, but it just never worked as easily as searching on my phone or laptop. This Android tablet is really easy to use. It works just like my phone, except it's larger. I can't use an iPad for the life of me. I don't have any Apple experience, so I just assumed tablets weren't for me. Now I've learned that I can use them just as easily as my other sources. I like the size of this a lot.

"Update - the kindly people at Snugg sent me a new case, frankly, I wasn't real enthused about it, I figured it would probably still have the design flaws that made it a worthless $20 investment, but I was wrong, wrong, wrong.  That will show me to stop being such a pessimist.  I couldn't be happier with this now, it is everything I was hoping for, it clips on to the strap of my apron when I'm getting my cooking on, it hooks onto my backpack when I'm out riding.  All in all, it is wonderful.<br /><br />The headphone/earbud thingies I use, pretty standard ones called Coby also the ones that came with my ipod are able to make contact with the bottom portal which is now clear of the protective rubber.  The carabiner clip seems slightly more substantial, I'd have to weigh it or take it apart somehow to verify this part.<br /><br />So here's my old review, use this for info, in case you end up with a flawed Snugg, I guess you should just return it then, or maybe the bugs have been worked out now and all new Snuggs are good.  Anyways, here's the old review with a listing of the pertinent problems.<br /><br /> !OLD REVIEW!<br /><br />The problems Other people have mentioned, mainly the difficulty inserting the nano into the clip case, wasn't really a problem for me.  After watching my husband struggle with it for a few minutes I pulled it away from him and decided to do it myself.  I was aided in this task by two things, 1) I have more fine motor skills than he does and a lot more experience with tiny detail work (painting, beading, etc) and 2) I have fingernails, real ones not acrylic (I think acrylic nails would be too thick).<br /><br />I used the thin edge of my fingernail to seat the bottom of the nano in the case after sliding it top first under the rubber part at the top of the clip case.<br /><br />Once it was in my iPod did appear to be very secure.  The carabina clip is a bit of an exaggeration, it isn't nearly as sturdy as a carabiner, the like of which is used by climbers, this is more of a jewelry version and feels very lightweight, I'm not pleased with that.<br /><br />I paid $8 more for the clip aspect of this case and the clip is there but isn't as functional and sturdy as I'd hoped.<br /><br />The second fail for this case is that the rubber casing covers part of the headphone port.<br /><br />I bought this case along with my new iPod, so once I'd unpacked both, I loaded a new audiobook onto my new iPod and slipped the case on and decided to take a listen.  Nothing.<br /><br />I couldn't hear anything at all.  It was so disappointing.  For a moment I thought that my new iPod was defective.  Nope.<br /><br />It turns out that there wasn't enough room for the headphone jack to make a complete connection unless you peeled back the case wall and held it in place while listening.<br /><br />So annoying.<br /><br />Anyways, I have a x-acto knife and have been debating whether or not to modify the bottom of the case myself (the clip isn't great and it kinda ticks me off that I have to act as seamstress for this failure of a product if I want to use it).  But sending stuff back is tedious and time consuming (okay, it takes about five minutes to return stuff on Amazon, but still, I don't want to do it!).",5.0,update the kindly people at snugg sent me a new case frankly i wasnt real enthused about it i figured it would probably still have the design flaws that made it a worthless investment but i was wrong wrong wrong that will show me to stop being such a pessimist i couldnt be happier with this now it is everything i was hoping for it clips on to the strap of my apron when im getting my cooking on it hooks onto my backpack when im out riding all in all it is wonderfulbr br the headphoneearbud thingies i use pretty standard ones called coby also the ones that came with my ipod are able to make contact with the bottom portal which is now clear of the protective rubber the carabiner clip seems slightly more substantial id have to weigh it or take it apart somehow to verify this partbr br so heres my old review use this for info in case you end up with a flawed snugg i guess you should just return it then or maybe the bugs have been worked out now and all new snuggs are good anyways heres the old review with a listing of the pertinent problemsbr br old reviewbr br the problems other people have mentioned mainly the difficulty inserting the nano into the clip case wasnt really a problem for me after watching my husband struggle with it for a few minutes i pulled it away from him and decided to do it myself i was aided in this task by two things i have more fine motor skills than he does and a lot more experience with tiny detail work painting beading etc and i have fingernails real ones not acrylic i think acrylic nails would be too thickbr br i used the thin edge of my fingernail to seat the bottom of the nano in the case after sliding it top first under the rubber part at the top of the clip casebr br once it was in my ipod did appear to be very secure the carabina clip is a bit of an exaggeration it isnt nearly as sturdy as a carabiner the like of which is used by climbers this is more of a jewelry version and feels very lightweight im not pleased with thatbr br i paid more for the clip aspect of this case and the clip is there but isnt as functional and sturdy as id hopedbr br the second fail for this case is that the rubber casing covers part of the headphone portbr br i bought this case along with my new ipod so once id unpacked both i loaded a new audiobook onto my new ipod and slipped the case on and decided to take a listen nothingbr br i couldnt hear anything at all it was so disappointing for a moment i thought that my new ipod was defective nopebr br it turns out that there wasnt enough room for the headphone jack to make a complete connection unless you peeled back the case wall and held it in place while listeningbr br so annoyingbr br anyways i have a xacto knife and have been debating whether or not to modify the bottom of the case myself the clip isnt great and it kinda ticks me off that i have to act as seamstress for this failure of a product if i want to use it but sending stuff back is tedious and time consuming okay it takes about five minutes to return stuff on amazon but still i dont want to do it,3067

"I've tried a couple of the USB fans and have found them to be loud, ineffective at moving air, or unwilling to hold a set position (and sometimes all three at the same time). This fan, however, actually works. And it works very well!<br /><br />The build quality is impressive given the price. The gooseneck stalk is sturdy, and holds the fan in the position set without drooping or creeping down over time. The noise output is minor - you can hear it, but the sound is very muted and not at all objectionable.<br /><br />What really impressed me is the amount of air this moves. It actually moves enough air to make a difference, which is something that is not often seen in a USB personal fan. Great for the office, but also an effective cooling fan when exercising on something such as a treadmill.<br /><br />I'm using this by powering it with a powerbank. Very little battery drain in use - I left it running overnight attached to a small powerbank (8400mAh) and the power indicator on the powerbank showed it was still at the 75% level.<br /><br />Best USB fan I've used bar none - highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",5.0,ive tried a couple of the usb fans and have found them to be loud ineffective at moving air or unwilling to hold a set position and sometimes all three at the same time this fan however actually works and it works very wellbr br the build quality is impressive given the price the gooseneck stalk is sturdy and holds the fan in the position set without drooping or creeping down over time the noise output is minor you can hear it but the sound is very muted and not at all objectionablebr br what really impressed me is the amount of air this moves it actually moves enough air to make a difference which is something that is not often seen in a usb personal fan great for the office but also an effective cooling fan when exercising on something such as a treadmillbr br im using this by powering it with a powerbank very little battery drain in use i left it running overnight attached to a small powerbank mah and the power indicator on the powerbank showed it was still at the levelbr br best usb fan ive used bar none highly recommendbr sample provided for review,1069

"Power supplies are an easy to overlook part of a build. Enough watts is enough watts right? It's a tempting part of the build to try to skimp on and save a few bucks. But it's a worthwhile investment to get a trusted brand. A PSU can survive multiple builds. You'll be upgrading other parts long before you have to replace a quality PSU. This investment in the future saves money in the long run. Not to mention the peace of mind that it won't catch fire or something!<br /><br />Trusted brands and quality PSU's don't all have to be Gold and Platinum though. You don't have to go all out. Doesn't hurt if you can afford it. But a quality Bronze is miles ahead of a generic Gold that has over promised. I was slapping this thing in a HTPC build and just wanted reliability. It's more than enough. EVGA uses and contracts out quality manufacturers on their PSU lines. Of which they arguably have too many. But you're almost assuredly in good hands with EVGA PSUs. Their customer service is amazing and second to none, which is becoming increasingly hard to come by in the tech space.<br /><br />As of the writing of this EVGA is the whole package.

"While these headphones are certainly not small, they do fold up conveniently and they come with a nice carry bag.  However, while since is a factor, the overriding question is:  how do they sound?  How do they feel after wearing them for hours?<br /><br />The answer to both of these question is FANTASTIC!  The sound is extremely clean and effortless.  I watched the movie &#34;Arrival&#34; with them on, which includes a lot of very low frequency content.  Amazing!  Music is pure and the sonic field is very well represented.<br /><br />After hours on your head, they still feel comfortable.  This is due to the fact that they barely touch your ears.  The soft cups surround your ears rather than press on them.<br /><br />So the term &#34;Monitor&#34; in the title of this product is well deserved.  Yamaha is a great brand name (my receiver/amp is Yamaha), and I have to say, the overall quality of their products in general is excellent.  These headphones are no exception.<br /><br />They also come with two cords - one coiled, one not.  The cord is removable, and also locks into place so it will not dislodge accidentally.  It also includes the usual ¼&#34; phone plug attachment to the mini plugs.<br /><br />if you are looking for style, or inconspicuous, forget it with these earphones.

"This powerful, silent, unmanaged Ethernet switch has 24 fast PoE ports (100 Mbps) that not only provide high speed internet (2 Gigabit Uplink) but automatically detects if the plugged in device needs power and, if so, how much!<br /><br />I did thorough testing on this unit over the last several months and I am thoroughly impressed by the performance.<br /><br />By utilizing the built in chip this switch will provide up to 30 watts to every Ethernet device connected (up to a total of 360 watts) but will not provide any power to devices that do not require power.  I found that this switch works absolutely flawlessly.<br /><br />Having the capability to provide ample internet speed and power at the same time makes this switch perfect for both business environments and as a hub for security systems.<br /><br />I used this switch within my security system setup and mounted it within my security closet.  I love that it is easily wall mountable but it can also be mounted within a rack with no problem.<br /><br />I’ve tested my unit extensively using different security cameras and the results are nothing short of incredible.  While most security cameras can be run via WiFi, nearly all of them still require a power adapter be plugged in.  By utilizing this hub, security breaches are all but eliminated - by utilizing Ethernet instead of Wifi transmission your local storage unit makes it so there is no easy out of network access.  In addition, transfer speed, resolution and picture quality is greatly increased - making the entire system more useful.  In my experience, I found power is much easier to manage utilizing this method as opposed to having to run separate power supplies to each camera.<br /><br />I have found this switch is rock solid and perfect for use as an unmanaged PoE switch for security cameras.<br /><br />This is an all around outstanding product that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.

"This was purchased months ago, and it's holding up just fine.  It's reasonably priced. It gets average to heavy use, no gaming except for some serious solitaire sessions.

"Just got this case, and I'm mostly pleased. It does add a bit of weight to the overall situation, so that has to be a trade off you are willing to make.<br /><br />The leather is nice. I got the Pro as a work machine, and this makes it feel more official. It has the look and feel of a nice paper notebook folio, which is what I was going for. It looks nice open and closed. It feels overall very sturdy, which I am sure contributes to the overall heft. Again, that's a trade off. Can't wait to take handwritten notes on this with the Pencil.<br /><br />As can see in the attached photo, in the first stop, it has just enough room to hold a Sharkk Bluetooth keyboard. This is effectively a laptop at that point. :) Together, they are WAY cheaper than the Apple Keyboard. Not as convenient, but I don't know how much I'll be typing on this. Will see.<br /><br />The lowest stop feels most comfortable for viewing in your lap.<br /><br />It feels a bit odd if you're thinking of it as a notebook (I mean the paper kind) folio, where you'd just flip and wrap the cover around. This is because of the dual function flap to hold it for viewing. I imagine it will take some getting used to and maybe breaking it in.<br /><br />The pen/stylus holder is another feature that made me buy this one. Given that the Apple Pencil has no way to attach, by default. It is elastic and thin enough that I expect it will hold the Pencil just fine. (I am still waiting on my Pencil like everyone else.) In the meantime, the included pen and rubber nub stylus is a nice stand in.<br /><br />The auto off/on magnet seems to work as expected.<br /><br />It has two openings at the top of the iPad. I am not sure why. There don't appear to be any sensors there, but maybe they know something I don't. Other than that, all of the speakers, ports, buttons, cameras, etc. are easily accessible.<br /><br />For this style case, this product seems to have nailed it, in looks, in utility, and in price.",5.0,just got this case and im mostly pleased it does add a bit of weight to the overall situation so that has to be a trade off you are willing to makebr br the leather is nice i got the pro as a work machine and this makes it feel more official it has the look and feel of a nice paper notebook folio which is what i was going for it looks nice open and closed it feels overall very sturdy which i am sure contributes to the overall heft again thats a trade off cant wait to take handwritten notes on this with the pencilbr br as can see in the attached photo in the first stop it has just enough room to hold a sharkk bluetooth keyboard this is effectively a laptop at that point together they are way cheaper than the apple keyboard not as convenient but i dont know how much ill be typing on this will seebr br the lowest stop feels most comfortable for viewing in your lapbr br it feels a bit odd if youre thinking of it as a notebook i mean the paper kind folio where youd just flip and wrap the cover around this is because of the dual function flap to hold it for viewing i imagine it will take some getting used to and maybe breaking it inbr br the penstylus holder is another feature that made me buy this one given that the apple pencil has no way to attach by default it is elastic and thin enough that i expect it will hold the pencil just fine i am still waiting on my pencil like everyone else in the meantime the included pen and rubber nub stylus is a nice stand inbr br the auto offon magnet seems to work as expectedbr br it has two openings at the top of the ipad i am not sure why there dont appear to be any sensors there but maybe they know something i dont other than that all of the speakers ports buttons cameras etc are easily accessiblebr br for this style case this product seems to have nailed it in looks in utility and in price,1855

"Wireless headphones are great, but I have a love/hate relationship with using Bluetooth on a PC. When using the mic with headset profile for calls, the audio gets routed totally differently than regular stereo sound (A2DP), which gets confusing if multitasking and playing sound while also using the mic. And then there's the delay/lag etc that usually comes along with Bluetooth from a Windows desktop. But that's why I love the USB dongle here!<br />Plug the little USB bit in, and it detects the headphones like an alternate sound card, full blown crystal clear stereo audio, even if using the mic! And the mic can be extended or retracted, something I love since I lost the removable mic on my old headphones.<br />But, if I want to use it with my phone or tablet, I can revert to standard Bluetooth and connect that way on my Android devices.

"Since I already had an Amazon account setup was super easy. I would say within 5 minutes for each camera it was setup and working. I did download the Amazon Cloud Cam app first before I plugged in the camera for setup. It has to boot up and get into setup mode which took about 3 minutes.<br />Caught the two cameras I ordered on sale for $59 each which was a really nice price point. I would say they are worth the full price after using for a week.<br />I had read reviews and many of the downside issues like reconnecting to wifi after and internet outage or power outage seem to have been totally resolved with updates for software and or firmware. You can unplug and move to another room and when it boots up it reconnects to wifi. Same with an internet outage when re-established it will connect back to the network. At least both mentioned above have been my experience.<br />Picture quality I would assume is mainly a matter of your internet connection to the cloud. I live rural and only have a 6mb DSL service and both cameras work and record to the cloud. Picture quality is okay but I am sure it would be much better if I had a higher bandwidth like most people that live in a city.<br />You can setup schedules for when the camera should be on or off, you can setup HomeAway so if you leave the house the camera will automatically come when your phone GPS shows you are no longer in the house location. For alerts you can set them for instantaneous or several options for delayed alerts. On the &quot;no subscription&quot; plan you can view the recorded video for 24 hours and then it is wiped. You also have the ability to remove a recording anytime you want using the cloud cam phone app or computer app at https://cloudcam.amazon.com/<br />Integration with Alexa is nice for turning on a camera or asking for a camera live view (if you have fire TV or a compatible Alexa device with a view screen.<br />Got these mainly for when we are traveling so if someone broke in we could contact police and also have a recording we could send the police (both available &quot;without&quot; subscription for 24 hours). Recording starts as soon as motion is detected without any lag time from my testing. I know reading some reviews of other products like blink the lag time prevented capturing a full video of an incident.<br />The thing I like most about Amazon products so far is that Amazon has constantly improving the software and firmware on their devices like echo, fire tv, etc and regardless of the generation of device it gets the update. Some manufactures (Apple) quit supporting updates for older devices (3 years or less old) and push you to buy new and so far that is not the case with Amazon.<br />Well this is a long review for me and I could go on but if you have questions just ask.",5.0,since i already had an amazon account setup was super easy i would say within minutes for each camera it was setup and working i did download the amazon cloud cam app first before i plugged in the camera for setup it has to boot up and get into setup mode which took about minutesbr caught the two cameras i ordered on sale for each which was a really nice price point i would say they are worth the full price after using for a weekbr i had read reviews and many of the downside issues like reconnecting to wifi after and internet outage or power outage seem to have been totally resolved with updates for software and or firmware you can unplug and move to another room and when it boots up it reconnects to wifi same with an internet outage when reestablished it will connect back to the network at least both mentioned above have been my experiencebr picture quality i would assume is mainly a matter of your internet connection to the cloud i live rural and only have a mb dsl service and both cameras work and record to the cloud picture quality is okay but i am sure it would be much better if i had a higher bandwidth like most people that live in a citybr you can setup schedules for when the camera should be on or off you can setup homeaway so if you leave the house the camera will automatically come when your phone gps shows you are no longer in the house location for alerts you can set them for instantaneous or several options for delayed alerts on the quotno subscriptionquot plan you can view the recorded video for hours and then it is wiped you also have the ability to remove a recording anytime you want using the cloud cam phone app or computer app at integration with alexa is nice for turning on a camera or asking for a camera live view if you have fire tv or a compatible alexa device with a view screenbr got these mainly for when we are traveling so if someone broke in we could contact police and also have a recording we could send the police both available quotwithoutquot subscription for hours recording starts as soon as motion is detected without any lag time from my testing i know reading some reviews of other products like blink the lag time prevented capturing a full video of an incidentbr the thing i like most about amazon products so far is that amazon has constantly improving the software and firmware on their devices like echo fire tv etc and regardless of the generation of device it gets the update some manufactures apple quit supporting updates for older devices years or less old and push you to buy new and so far that is not the case with amazonbr well this is a long review for me and i could go on but if you have questions just ask,2691

"I originally purchased a 26 Vizio VA 10T.  I had some initial problems and read the warranty.  On TVs less than 32 inches, Vizio requires that you ship the TV to California at your expense.  I don't think so.  I returned it to Walmart, and then purchased this TV at Sams.  In home service on this one.<br /><br />This TV has much higher quality and workmanship than the 26 inch model.  Excellent PQ, VG sound, VG viewing angle, no glare. .  The cable hookups go in horizontally, while the 26 inch model had vertical hookups.  The vertical hookups would be fine with a wall mount, but were difficult to use on my stand.<br /><br />Cons.  Remote is pretty basic, and the menu is somewhat confusing.  Since this is used with Direct TV, I only use the Vizio remote to change some preferences.<br /><br />Addressing comments  on Walmart purchases.  Consider this.  I initially purchased the 26 inch model.  I paid a pre BF price of $ 248, reg. $ 327-348.  At $ 248, my 3 year extended warranty was $ 19.99.  I wasn't happy withe TV, returned it, and did not have to pay a restocking charge (hello-Best Buy).  I had to open the Box, and remove the TV, to get to and read the warranty. Only then did I find out I needed to ship the TV to California, at my expense, for warranty work.  Even under the Wally 3 year extended warranty, the mfg terms still applied.  So for any warranty work, I needed to ship it at my expense.  I think it stinks that companies don't disclose the significant  terms of their warranty more prominently, prior to purchase.  Their behavior sticks you with restocking fees.  Love this 32 inch Vizio.

"When I pulled this little camera case out of its box, I immediately thought it was going to be too small for my Fujifilm FinePix Z700EXR camera, but it fit perfectly! This is a sturdy, classy, soft-leather case with soft grey suede inside. The little inside pocket for carrying an extra battery is tight and out of the way; I'll probably use it to put identification inside in case I ever leave the camera lying on a table somewhere. With my camera's side strap sticking out of one side (which I prefer to running it through the top hole because access is quicker), it's like a little mini-purse. The cutout in the top happens to be right over the USB cable port on my camera, so if I had to (but I probably won't), I could run the USB cable to it without removing the camera from its case. Another thing I could do if I wanted to is use that little hole to loop an ID tag or small ID/credit card holder through using one of those beaded lamp-pull type thingies. Then I really could travel light.<br /><br />Little things mean a lot to me, and I have to say I just love the magnetic clasp underneath the low-key silverish AmazonBasics logo on the front of the case. The magnet is not so strong as to be annoyingly hard to pull apart, but it's strong enough to do the job without slipping. The little circular magnetic piece in the clasp has a small center button that fits into a recession in the other part of the clasp; when closing the cover, you hear a satisfying little click when you slide it into place, so you know it's snugly closed.<br /><br />I was thinking when I got this (not paying great attention) that the holder ""clip"" on the back was actually a clip suitable for clipping to the edge of your pants or a coat pocket, but it's not. It's actually better than that, because we all know how quickly those clips break off our cell phones. This one closes with strong velcro so you can loop it through a belt loop or other strap or onto a belt. The part of the holder that does not have velcro on it is not quite an inch wide, though, so it wouldn't work as well with wider belts. With the camera in it, it would be too heavy (at least for me) to want to wear around your neck, but you could definitely put it on a lanyard if you wanted to&mdash;and then perhaps stick it in a breast pocket so it's not dangling. One nice thing about the velcro is that, even though it is sewn on very well, part of the piece that is sewn to the camera case actually lifts up as you pull the velcro apart. This should extend the life of the case because you're not pulling against case stitching when you're trying to get it apart. This is not wimpy velcro, so you have to tug a bit to get it open.<br /><br />I really like it!",5.0,when i pulled this little camera case out of its box i immediately thought it was going to be too small for my fujifilm finepix zexr camera but it fit perfectly this is a sturdy classy softleather case with soft grey suede inside the little inside pocket for carrying an extra battery is tight and out of the way ill probably use it to put identification inside in case i ever leave the camera lying on a table somewhere with my cameras side strap sticking out of one side which i prefer to running it through the top hole because access is quicker its like a little minipurse the cutout in the top happens to be right over the usb cable port on my camera so if i had to but i probably wont i could run the usb cable to it without removing the camera from its case another thing i could do if i wanted to is use that little hole to loop an id tag or small idcredit card holder through using one of those beaded lamppull type thingies then i really could travel lightbr br little things mean a lot to me and i have to say i just love the magnetic clasp underneath the lowkey silverish amazonbasics logo on the front of the case the magnet is not so strong as to be annoyingly hard to pull apart but its strong enough to do the job without slipping the little circular magnetic piece in the clasp has a small center button that fits into a recession in the other part of the clasp when closing the cover you hear a satisfying little click when you slide it into place so you know its snugly closedbr br i was thinking when i got this not paying great attention that the holder clip on the back was actually a clip suitable for clipping to the edge of your pants or a coat pocket but its not its actually better than that because we all know how quickly those clips break off our cell phones this one closes with strong velcro so you can loop it through a belt loop or other strap or onto a belt the part of the holder that does not have velcro on it is not quite an inch wide though so it wouldnt work as well with wider belts with the camera in it it would be too heavy at least for me to want to wear around your neck but you could definitely put it on a lanyard if you wanted tomdashand then perhaps stick it in a breast pocket so its not dangling one nice thing about the velcro is that even though it is sewn on very well part of the piece that is sewn to the camera case actually lifts up as you pull the velcro apart this should extend the life of the case because youre not pulling against case stitching when youre trying to get it apart this is not wimpy velcro so you have to tug a bit to get it openbr br i really like it,2631

I have gone through a bunch of different charging cords. Most have been too cheap and have frayed. These are packaged well and are more substantial than the others. The cord is thicker and the ends are reinforced. These are approved by Apple and this does make a difference. If you use substitutes sooner or later you will get an “incompatible  device” warning.

Over all my experience with the filter holder is excellent. I used the nano pro series. It's all metal. Made of quality materials. It comes the filter holder that will allow you to add 3 filters instead of two. The filter is made of aluminum. I did not want to go plastic I want something that'll last me for many years. Don't buy cheap. The filters that I use from this company are top-notch the nano pro series and the red diamond series. No color casting with their filters. I definitely recommend it it's a little expensive starting out and getting your camera setup for this type of filter system. But you will definitely be pleased in the end. Having a quality product that will last you. I definitely recommend getting the polarizer filter for the holder. It's nice for certain conditions having that polarizer that naturally add apps to this system. Overall I am very pleased with their system. Get it you will be happy. The filters fits snug I used two mm thickness square filters. There's no worry of them sliding out. you can use the lee filters in this system as well. It's not a quick attachment where you pull the lever and pull up the filter holder off. You actually have to screw the filter on. But it allows you to rotate your filter easily. Weather use a solid ND filter or a soft grad or hard edge. You will be able to rotate and slide your filter up and down with ease without the worry of them falling out. Definitely top-notch quality I definitely recommend using the Haida pro series.

"I have used a few different NAS products in the past for my home and business networks, but this Netgear Ready NAS really puts them all to shame. Granted, the cost of this Ready NAS 12 bay model was quite a bit higher than I had paid for any of those other models, but this is really a mile ahead when it comes to storage capacity, performance and reliability.<br /><br />Front and center with this model is the web-based software interface. It reminds me of some of the better UPS software interfaces I have used in the past, with fine tuning and detailed diagnostics available on just about every aspect of the device's operations. The NAS' complexity can largely be safely ignored during normal operations, but if you need to do any advanced troubleshooting or diagnostics the web interface should provide you with everything you need.<br /><br />Initial setup of the device is simple, but not exactly speedy, unless you happen to be starting off with a bunch of unformatted drives of the same, exact capacity. I had six drives to use with this device, which only used up half of the system's total capacity. I initially started the system with just two drives. The software automatically configured the system into a RAID 1 array, which is the only form of RAID available with two drives. As soon as I added the third drive it auto-configured itself into a RAID 5 array. I kept adding drives until I got all six running. In all, it took a bit over 7 hours for all of the drives to sync themselves. I only spent about 5 minutes setting everything up. The rest of the time was spent waiting for the drives to finish syncing. Having configured RAID arrays on both Windows and LINUX servers in the past, I can tell you that it always seems to take forever for drives to finish syncing, but it's perfectly normal.<br /><br />What really impressed me with the initial setup was that I basically just installed a bunch of random mechanical hard drives that I had laying around of various makes, models, capacities and rotation speeds. One of them even had a few known bad sectors on it, but they were all recognized, formatted and synced with no problem whatsoever. I did get a warning about the bad sectors on the one drive, but the system simply worked around them for the time being. Nice.<br /><br />Despite having dual, redundant power supplies and the ability to support up to 12x 7,200 RPM mechanical drives, the system only used around 75 WATTS of electricity with six drive bays occupied. That is amazingly efficient compared to past models I have used. Each PSU has its own power cord and can be pulled out in a hot-swap fashion. The drives can also be easily hot-swapped during normal operations with no downtime. In addition to the 12 drive bays in front, there are also two 2 eSATA ports in the back and 2 USB 3.0 ports. I do not believe that external drives can be added as part of the system's combined RAID array, but they CAN be configured for independent network file sharing. I am not certain what, if any, limits exist on the number of external USB 3.0 drives that can be added and shared. In theory, you could possibly add dozens of additional drives in this fashion using a simple (external powered) USB hub though.<br /><br />On top of the internal and external storage capabilities, the system also supports iSCSI and various cloud drive services including Amazon S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon Cloud Drive, ReadyNAS Backup and ReadyCLOUD.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this device is the number of networking options available via the 4 included Gigabit Ethernet ports. Each port can be individually configured with it's own IP address and/or utilized in a bonded fashion with round-robin, load balancing, failover, bandwidth aggregation, etc. You can also assign ports to different networks and create custom VLANs. Both IPV4 and IPV6 can be mixed and matched on each interface as you wish.<br /><br />The system has a real-time antivrus scanner application included, but from what I can tell this is simply a free implementation of CLAMAV that comes with no documentation or support from Netgear. All that you can do from the web-based interface is turn it on or off and run updates. Turning it on WILL slow down the system. CLAMAV is open source with no heuristic scanning or intelligence to combat zero day exploits, so it should not be relied upon for anything but the most basic protection from known viruses.<br /><br />By far, the most surprising feature that I ran across with this device is the ability to deploy full-blown server applications via something that resembles an app store. Dozens of pre-screened apps are available for download via the web interface and can be easily deployed in a matter of minutes. Most of them are open source. Some fall under different licenses, but they include everything from the latest version of PHP to a full-blown Asterisk VoIP server. Some of the more recognizable apps available are MySQL, SugarCRM, Drupal, DVBlink, Joomla, Logitech Media Server, osCommerce, Twonky and apps to add Bittorrent, surveillance, DNS and a VPN server capabilities. The system already comes with the ability to share files via services such as SMB, SSH, FTP, Rsync, NFS, HTTPS, UPnP, ReadyDLNA, iTunes and more, so these additional apps are just icing on the cake. All of the apps are free, without licensing costs, that I have tested so far.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention here is the product's excellent build quality. Obviously, this product was designed with business and industrial use in mind. It fits nicely into a standard 19&#34; rack and comes with rails, mounting hardware, Ethernet cables and everything you need to get up-and-running with just a screwdriver. There is a one page setup guide, but the rest of the documentation is online.<br /><br />Compared to setting up a Windows or LINUX based NAS server, this product is truly a walk in the park. It's flexibility as a platform is an unexpected bonus on top of its rock solid reliability and construction. It's basically a slam-dunk for any admin that needs to set up a little or a whole lot of network storage with no learning curve and no unexpected feature or hardware restrictions.",5.0,i have used a

Other reviewers said the range is far better than others so I was hesitant to buy 2PK of AXE11000 and was thinking may be just 1PK would be sufficient.  I wanted to try this theory first, so I connected just one of AXE11000s first to see if I can get 5G bandwidth in my Bedroom.  But my bedroom was still not getting 5GHz bandwidth. I proceeded with setting up the second unit and when connected the second unit, WOW! what a difference! I am now getting 5G speed of over 700Mbps speed.",5.0,i live in a single level home and my xfinity modem is in living room i always get only ghz bandwidth speed at my bedrooms may be due to interference from microwave and other kitchen appliances other reviewers said the range is far better than others so i was hesitant to buy pk of axe and was thinking may be just pk would be sufficient i wanted to try this theory first so i connected just one of axes first to see if i can get g bandwidth in my bedroom but my bedroom was still not getting ghz bandwidth i proceeded with setting up the second unit and when connected the second unit wow what a difference i am now getting g speed of over mbps speed,650

"I knew my old projector wasn't that fantastic, but I had no idea just how subpar it was until I plugged in this new 5G 400ANSI/10,000 Lumens, 1080P projector. You might not truly understand all the specs, but trust me, this is the clearest image I've seen next to an actual movie theater image. I did a before-and-after test with the same movie, and it was incredible. It was as if I'd just tried on a pair of glasses I didn't know I needed. Every blade of grass was clear and sparkly, the water rippled, and all the wrinkles and pores on the actors' faces were crystal clear (sorry actors). I pretty much felt sorry for myself that I'd been using my old, blurry projector for so long.<br />You can absolutely use this an outdoor projector, because the picture is so clear and bright, you don't even need to close the window shades when you're watching a matinee. With my entire balcony window open, the projected image is just as vivid on the opposing wall. Pretty remarkable.<br />The controls and remote are easy to use, with the focus and keystone dials right next to each other on the machine. It is a very large unit, though lightweight, and emits quite a bit of heat. So you might not want to put your chilled beer mug right next to the projector (if you're placing the unit on the coffee table, that is).",5.0,i knew my old projector wasnt that fantastic but i had no idea just how subpar it was until i plugged in this new g ansi lumens p projector you might not truly understand all the specs but trust me this is the clearest image ive seen next to an actual movie theater image i did a beforeandafter test with the same movie and it was incredible it was as if id just tried on a pair of glasses i didnt know i needed every blade of grass was clear and sparkly the water rippled and all the wrinkles and pores on the actors faces were crystal clear sorry actors i pretty much felt sorry for myself that id been using my old blurry projector for so longbr you can absolutely use this an outdoor projector because the picture is so clear and bright you dont even need to close the window shades when youre watching a matinee with my entire balcony window open the projected image is just as vivid on the opposing wall pretty remarkablebr the controls and remote are easy to use with the focus and keystone dials right next to each other on the machine it is a very large unit though lightweight and emits quite a bit of heat so you might not want to put your chilled beer mug right next to the projector if youre placing the unit on the coffee table that is,1249

I've had this speaker for a couple weeks and I'm happy with it.  It has great sound compared to my exceptionally-quiet Dell laptop.  Good bass too.  I have 2 suggestions for future versions of this speaker.<br /><br />1)  Either make the speaker cord longer or make it a modular connector (male 1/8 mini plug to male 1/8 mini plug).  That way we can choose our own cord length to meet our individual needs.<br /><br />2)  Make the unit take AA batteries for better battery length.  It won't require much more additional space than the AAA batteries currently.<br /><br />3)  Allow the unit to be powered from an external power source such as USB (dual-USB ports if necessary) or an AC adapter.  This would make the speaker useful for long road trips or long durations.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to others.,5.0,ive had this speaker for a couple weeks and im happy with it it has great sound compared to my exceptionallyquiet dell laptop good bass too i have suggestions for future versions of this speakerbr br either make the speaker cord longer or make it a modular connector male mini plug to male mini plug that way we can choose our own cord length to meet our individual needsbr br make the unit take aa batteries for better battery length it wont require much more additional space than the aaa batteries currentlybr br allow the unit to be powered from an external power source such as usb dualusb ports if necessary or an ac adapter this would make the speaker useful for long road trips or long durationsbr br i would recommend this product to others,749

"- I have tried so many different SD cards from various manufacturers, at various price points, in the name of trying to save a few bucks. It was really important to me back when a 128GB card cost $50 or more. They all do the same thing, so what’s the difference, really?<br />What I've found is that it can be extremely aggravating to put up with when the card does not perform well or does not perform at all. I have heard warning stories about cards that are advertised as one size and actually are another size, causing data loss. With that in mind, I have never tried using the very cheapest card or too-goo-to-be-true card deals. But I have purchased cards on sale at the drugstore or even tried some strange brands. What I have come back to is that it’s just not worth the trouble now that prices have dropped so low. When I am trusting 128 GB of data to a single card, it’s just not worth my time and aggravation to have a card that won’t perform. Furthermore, SanDisk cards like this one are all FAST ENOUGH. I’m not a pro photographer, and I don’t have time to figure out whether a card is Class 1 or Class 3 or whatever. I just want it to be good enough that it can keep up with my devices.<br /><br />I have now purchased several SanDisk cards, and each and everyone of them has arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly every time. They are faster than any other card that I use and I've never suffered data loss. I am putting this card into my Fiio X5ii Digital Audio Player, and it works just fine. During the initial data transfer I have already noticed that the speed is adequate, and I never experience skipping when playing uncompressed high-resolution audio files. I have the same card for my Nintendo Switch, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />The prices on these are so good now you have no excuse but to buy good name brand like SanDisk. Just buy it and don't worry about it.",5.0,i have tried so many different sd cards from various manufacturers at various price points in the name of trying to save a few bucks it was really important to me back when a gb card cost or more they all do the same thing so whats the difference reallybr what ive found is that it can be extremely aggravating to put up with when the card does not perform well or does not perform at all i have heard warning stories about cards that are advertised as one size and actually are another size causing data loss with that in mind i have never tried using the very cheapest card or toogootobetrue card deals but i have purchased cards on sale at the drugstore or even tried some strange brands what i have come back to is that its just not worth the trouble now that prices have dropped so low when i am trusting gb of data to a single card its just not worth my time and aggravation to have a card that wont perform furthermore sandisk cards like this one are all fast enough im not a pro photographer and i dont have time to figure out whether a card is class or class or whatever i just want it to be good enough that it can keep up with my devicesbr br i have now purchased several sandisk cards and each and everyone of them has arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly every time they are faster than any other card that i use and ive never suffered data loss i am putting this card into my fiio xii digital audio player and it works just fine during the initial data transfer i have already noticed that the speed is adequate and i never experience skipping when playing uncompressed highresolution audio files i have the same card for my nintendo switch and it works perfectlybr br the prices on these are so good now you have no excuse but to buy good name brand like sandisk just buy it and dont worry about it,1825

"I've used these successfully for many years. Great for quick change off the tripod. Only limit is that it is marked as being designed to hold no more than 6-1/2 pounds.<br /><br />I notice also that as it's spring loaded to secure the base plate to the QRC clamp, it does not attach the camera to the tripod absolutely tight. It's secure, but you can wiggle the camera a bit against the spring.<br /><br />The spring base body comes with a 1/4-20 threaded hole that mounts to the tripod head or other accessory. The plate in the early days went on the camera in only one direction. These days the plate has been reshaped so no matter how you put it on the camera, it will always fit the base adapter properly.<br /><br />To use it, you cock the base place against its spring by pushing in the latch on the left side. It catches in the open position. Then, when you drop the camera into the base, it releases the spring and clamps shut on the plate with a satisfying ""thwunk."" To release, press in the latch and lift.

"I just received this camera bag, so I cannot in truth comment on it's water resistance or durability.  I bought this bag for a new FujiFilm X100V camera.  The bag is a good size for a compact camera system. My camera does not accept accessory lenses so I'll only be carrying spare batteries, charger, filters, cable release and SD memory cards.  That will leave me with plenty of room for a few personal items.  The bag appears to be well constructed and durable. It's well padded and includes four Velcro-locking dividers.  My only complaint, so far, is that the zipper track is made of some kind of plastic material with dual metal pull tabs.  I would have preferred a more robust zipper, but for this price, the zipper will have to do. Overall, the bag is very attractive and professional looking much like a Billingham or Domke.  If it lasts half as long as either of those two, I'll be very happy.",5.0,i just received this camera bag so i cannot in truth comment on its water resistance or durability i bought this bag for a new fujifilm xv camera the bag is a good size for a compact camera system my camera does not accept accessory lenses so ill only be carrying spare batteries charger filters cable release and sd memory cards that will leave me with plenty of room for a few personal items the bag appears to be well constructed and durable its well padded and includes four velcrolocking dividers my only complaint so far is that the zipper track is made of some kind of plastic material with dual metal pull tabs i would have preferred a more robust zipper but for this price the zipper will have to do overall the bag is very attractive and professional looking much like a billingham or domke if it lasts half as long as either of those two ill be very happy,866

"Original(November 25, 2016): If you like listening to bass heavy music, this is likely one of the best $100ish level headphones you can get. Due to it's closed back construction, it keeps all that juicy bass in the headset, and you can crank this baby up quite a bit due to its low power usage compared to higher end audiophile headphones. As many others have stated, the general sound range is decent, but its cranked up for bass for sure, but can do general sound reproduction quite well for $100.<br /><br />If you are looking for proper audiophile entry level headphones, the Audiotechnica m50x would be my suggestion for general and bass heavy music, and the Sennheiser HD 598 are amazing for less bass heavy music, however those headphones are an extra 50% more expensive at about $150ish currently at the end of 2016.<br /><br />Also, if you are wondering how these stack up against Beats headphones... you are in for a mind-blowing experience. The vast majority of audiophiles, even newbies, generally understand that Beats are &#34;bling&#34;, more of a fashion statement than a sign of taste. Beats tends to cram cheapo components in their headphones, they were even caught cramming metal weights into their headphones to give them weight so they would &#34;feel like quality&#34;, and cranks the bass so high that everything else gets completely drowned out. If you dont believe me, then try this, plug in a set of &#34;high end&#34; Beats headphones to an average computer and crank the volume/power up to max, you might notice that the drivers are straining themselves and have maxed themselves, making the sound grainy and tinny, this is a sign that the drivers are low quality or designed for low power use only, now plug in a proper audiophile headset like an m50x and crank it up to max, those, even if they are entry level audiophile headphones, dont sound like they are straining themselves, you get crisp, accurate sound reproduction, even at high power levels. Now if you plug in a set of true high end studio level audiophile headphones, with proper audio equipment and an amp, it would literally be almost exactly like being in the studio with the artist recording the song at that moment, to the point where even people with golden hearing, who can hear the distinct digital differences between tones from electronic reproduction would have trouble telling the difference with completely uncompressed audio with a set of headphones like the Sennheiser HD 800 ($1000 set of headphones designed with the idea of perfect audio reproduction).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Powerful bass (prepare for some epic headbanging)<br />-Majority of sound range is good<br />-No need for an amp<br />-Price (&lt;$100)<br /><br />Cons<br />-Comfort (heavy pressure with on-ear construction to get that seal for good bass, I can only comfortably keep these on for a couple hours at a time)<br />-The stock cord is pretty short (approx 3ft [1m])<br /><br />Update (Feburary 2020): Things have seriously changed in the last 4-5 years in the audio space. Beats were purchased by Apple, and they dont make complete trash anymore, just mediocre bass-heavy overpriced cans. The pricing of Beats headphones are 50-100% higher than what they are really worth if you are going by actual price for performance.<br /><br />After having a chance to finally fix my pair and try them with a decent entry-level 2019 serious DAC+AMP (a Schiit Magni 3 Heresy stack) I am still pretty happy with the MDR-X10/REDs. Bass is pretty heavy, but not super loose, mids and highs are somewhat recessed, highs more so. Vocals will usually be weak-sounding. The resolution is ok. The soundstage is there, but small, not so bad that sounds never leave the inside of your skull, but its small enough that its in your face.<br /><br />I really wish they had an extra slightly longer cable, and if that cable ended in a 1/4 inch. They are incredibly easy to drive, so its easy to use with a phone (with a headphone jack) or straight out of your PC, even compared to my HD598, I tend to need to crank my amp maybe 10-20% more with the HD598 compared to the MDR-X10. There is no need for an amp at all, though they are good enough to be improved somewhat by using an amp.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is still a decent set of cans for a beginner to start their journey into hi-fi headphones, especially if you are a bit of a basshead. They dont do anything that is overtly offensive.",5.0,originalnovember if you like listening to bass heavy music this is likely one of the best ish level headphones you can get due to its closed back construction it keeps all that juicy bass in the headset and you can crank this baby up quite a bit due to its low power usage compared to higher end audiophile headphones as many others have stated the general sound range is decent but its cranked up for bass for sure but can do general sound reproduction quite well for br br if you are looking for proper audiophile entry level headphones the audiotechnica mx would be my suggestion for general and bass heavy music and the sennheiser hd are amazing for less bass heavy music however those headphones are an extra more expensive at about ish currently at the end of br br also if you are wondering how these stack up against beats headphones you are in for a mindblowing experience the vast majority of audiophiles even newbies generally understand that beats are bling more of a fashion statement than a sign of taste beats tends to cram cheapo components in their headphones they were even caught cramming metal weights into their headphones to give them weight so they would feel like quality and cranks the bass so high that everything else gets completely drowned out if you dont believe me then try this plug in a set of high end beats headphones to an average computer and crank the volumepower up to max you might notice that the drivers are straining themselves and have maxed themselves making the sound grainy and tinny this is a sign that the drivers are low quality or designed for low power use only now plug in a proper audiophile headset like an mx and crank it up to max those even if they are entry level audiophile headphones dont sound like they are straining themselves you get crisp accurate sound reproduction even at high power levels now if you plug in a set of true high end studio level audiophile headphones with proper audio equipment and an amp it would literally be almost exactly like being in the studio with the artist recording the song at that moment to the point where even people with golden hearing who can hear the distinct digital differences between tones from electronic reproduction would have trouble telling the difference with completely uncompressed audio with a set of headphones like the sennheiser hd set of headphones designed with the idea of perfect audio reproductionbr br prosbr powerful bass prepare for some epic headbangingbr majority of sound range is goodbr no need for an ampbr price ltbr br consbr comfort heavy pressure with onear construction to get that seal for good bass i can only comfortably keep these on for a couple hours at a timebr the stock cord is pretty short approx ft mbr br update feburary things have seriously changed in the last years in the audio space beats were purchased by apple and they dont make complete trash anymore just mediocre bassheavy overpriced cans the pricing of beats headphones are higher than what they are really worth if you are going by actual price for performancebr br after having a chance to finally fix my pair and try them with a decent entrylevel serious dacamp a schiit magni heresy stack i am still pretty happy with the mdrxreds bass is pretty heavy but not super loose mids and highs are somewhat recessed highs more so vocals will usually be weaksounding the resolution is ok the soundstage is there but small not so bad that sounds never leave the inside of your skull but its small enough that its in your facebr br i really wish they had an extra slightly longer cable and if that cable ended in a inch they are incredibly easy to drive so its easy to use with a phone with a headphone jack or straight out of your pc even compared to my hd i tend to need to crank my amp maybe more with the hd compared to the mdrx there is no need for an amp at all though they are good enough to be improved somewhat by using an ampbr br overall i think this is still a decent set of cans for a beginner to start their journey into hifi headphones especially if you are a bit of a basshead they dont do anything that is overtly offensive,4146

"I selected this mouse with the thought that it would be a good travel mouse. I like the feature set, specifically the ability to recharge the mouse instead of replacing the batteries. So far, I have had no issues with this mouse. In the price range, it’s a good one.<br /><br />The mouse comes in a little mesh bag which sets it up nicely for use as a travel mouse. I can toss the whole in my bag and the USB dongle will stay with it even if it slips off the mouse.<br /><br />The mouse quickly connects once the dongle is plugged in, and I have not had any trouble with it. It’s responsive and does not skip or stutter.<br /><br />One of the things about this mouse that stands out to me is actually the shape. Most mice are somewhat arched but do not have enough arch to fit my hand properly. This one is much more arched than most. I still prefer my trackball, but I do not have any issue with using this mouse because the fit in my hand causes less cramping for me.<br /><br />Charging this mouse is fast and easy.

"Overall I'm very pleased with these ear buds. Lots of pros:<br /><br />- very comfortable to wear. I always have ear buds in when working out, and these stayed put through all my cardio work with zero ear soreness.<br /><br />- sound quality is great. I was listening to Friday Night in San Francisco (John Mclaughlin, Al Dimeola and Pco De Lucia) and was amazed at how much of the mid-range sound I was missing using my old ear buds (JBLs). The bass is not boomy, but more than adequate. I found I was able to get better bass sound by changing the rubber tips to a larger size that better fit my ear.<br /><br />- lots of nice touches such as a carrying case that is well designed to protect the ear buds, a selection of rubber ear tips, and even a cleaning tool. It also comes with an airplane jack adapter, but I won't get much use out of that.<br /><br />- outstanding sound isolation. No ambient sound gets in at all. In fact, I had to take one of them out when I was doing road work since I was concerned about not being able to hear cars approaching.<br /><br />My quibbles are minor and mainly relate to the sturdiness of the cabling. It seems pretty thin and may not stand up to the rigors I often put my ear buds through. Too early to tell if this will be a problem, so I didn't subtract any stars because of it.

"Amazon sells this camera alone for $400, so this $400 kit with the camera and a bunch of accessories means the accessories are essentially free. I received the camera quickly and it works great out of the box. The 30x zoom is not a gimmick. I took this camera to the America's Cup yacht races in San Francisco and was able to take clear photos of the individual boats, even when they were miles away from shore. At a baseball game, I can zoom in close enough to read the writing on a baseball bat, even though I am sitting in the cheap seats. You do need good sunlight to use the zoom; results are much less interesting indoors since either high ISO or long shutter speeds will create blurry photos.<br /><br />The zoom isn't this camera's only great feature. The HX50 also takes great macro photos since it can focus sharply on objects (flowers, insects, coins, etc) that are just 1cm away from the lens. This is a great feature for nature photographers (just like the zoom is great for photographing distant wild animals). Sometimes you have to try several time before it focuses on your closeup subject though, especially if their are multiple objects in your scene (like focusing on one flower in a bunch).<br /><br />I'm happy with the camera's WiFi features, though many professional reviews are not. Perhaps that is because I am using an Android smartphone and all the pro reviewers are using iphones. The WiFi works flawlessly for me, allowing me to quickly upload photos to my phone in the field, then post them to the internet from my phone (great for sports and other events). I especially like being able to select individual photos to upload with WiFi. I've used EyeFi in other camera and that really kills your battery because it uploads all your photos all the time. The WiFi in this camera seems to have minimal effect on battery life (if you're only uploading selected photos).<br /><br />I've only tried the WiFi remote control a couple of times and it worked as expected. I can imagine this being useful if you're standing in a crowd at a concert or other event and want to hold the camera over your head (above the crowd) and still compose the scene accurately.<br /><br />The GPS works great, too, at least outdoors. GPS locks on quickly and surprisingly  doesn't seem to have a big effect on battery life (like it does with some other GPS cameras I have owned in the past). GPS is great if you're shooting at a lot of different locations on the same day, especially if you are on vacation and don't really remember where you shot the photo. The GPS coordinates are stored in a standard format in each image's meta data so you can view it using a wide variety of tools.<br /><br />The camera has a ton of modes that may or may not be useful to you. I really like the aperture priority mode, instead of the auto-everything mode. Being able to force the aperture wide open is a really great feature for sports and wildlife photos. An exposure override dial on top of the camera is another really great feature that even many SLR cameras do not have. HDR and panorama modes don't work as well as photoshop, but doing it in-camera is really simple and allows you to immediately post to the internet using the camera's WiFi feature. I don't use any of the ""creative scene"" modes, though those are apparently popular with kids.<br /><br />The main negative for this camera is that image quality is only mediocre, especially compared to Sony's RX100 which packs a big image sensor in a camera that is smaller than the HX50. Packing that sensor into a 30X zoom camera would unfortunately violate the laws of physics, at least with the current state of the art for lens design. If you take a lot of indoors or nighttime photos where the 30X zoom is not real useful, you should look hard at the RX100 which takes much better photos in those conditions.<br /><br />Some people complain about the lack of RAW mode, but realistically this camera does not have good enough image quality for RAW to be really useful. If you care about your image detail enough to want RAW, you should buy an RX100 instead.<br /><br />It is hard to complain about the accessories in this bundle when they are essentially free. However, only the Sony memory card is a name brand item and at only 16GB it is far from Sony's top-of-the-line. The camera case is secured by a small piece of velcro that I don't trust. The tripod is flimsy and not adjustable and probably only useful for indoor tabletop use. The battery is generic with unknown quality. The card reader and screen protectors are very low quality. I wish they had provided fewer accessories that were better quality since I will discard most of these unused, but again I can't complain too much when they are essentially free.",5.0,amazon sells this camera alone for so this kit with the camera and a bunch of accessories means the accessories are essentially free i received the camera quickly and it works great out of the box the x zoom is not a gimmick i took this camera to the americas cup yacht races in san francisco and was able to take clear photos of the individual boats even when they were miles away from shore at a baseball game i can zoom in close enough to read the writing on a baseball bat even though i am sitting in the cheap seats you do need good sunlight to use the zoom results are much less interesting indoors since either high iso or long shutter speeds will create blurry photosbr br the zoom isnt this cameras only great feature the hx also takes great macro photos since it can focus sharply on objects flowers insects coins etc that are just cm away from the lens this is a great feature for nature photographers just like the zoom is great for photographing distant wild animals sometimes you have to try several time before it focuses on your closeup subject though especially if their are multiple objects in your scene like focusing on one flower in a bunchbr br im happy with the cameras wifi features though many professional reviews are not perhaps that is because i am using an android smartphone and all the pro reviewers are using iphones the wifi works flawlessly for me allowing me to quickly upload photos to my phone in the field then post them to the internet from my phone great for sports and other events i especially like being able to select individual photos to upload with wifi ive used eyefi in other camera and that really kills your battery because it uploads all your photos all the time the wifi in this camera seems to have minimal effect on battery life if youre only uploading selected photosbr br ive only tried the wifi remote control a couple of times and it worked as expected i can imagine this being useful if youre standing in a crowd at a concert or other event and want to hold the camera over your head above the crowd and still compose the scene accuratelybr br the gps works great too at least outdoors gps locks on quickly and surprisingly doesnt seem to have a big effect on battery life like it does with some other gps cameras i have owned in the past gps is great if youre shooting at a lot of different locations on the same day especially if you are on vacation and dont really remember where you shot the photo the gps coordinates are stored in a standard format in each images meta data so you can view it using a wide variety of toolsbr br the camera has a ton of modes that may or may not be useful to you i really like the aperture priority mode instead of the autoeverything mode being able to force the aperture wide open is a really great feature for sports and wildlife photos an exposure override dial on top of the camera is another really great feature that even many slr cameras do not have hdr and panorama modes dont work as well as photoshop but doing it incamera is really simple and allows you to immediately post to the internet using the cameras wifi feature i dont use any of the creative scene modes though those are apparently popular with kidsbr br the main negative for this camera is that image quality is only mediocre especially compared to sonys rx which packs a big image sensor in a camera that is smaller than the hx packing that sensor into a x zoom camera would unfortunately violate the laws of physics at least with the current state of the art for lens design if you take a lot of indoors or nighttime photos where the x zoom is not real useful you should look hard at the rx which takes much better photos in those conditionsbr br some people complain about the lack of raw mode but realistically this camera does not have good enough image quality for raw to be really useful if you care about your image detail enough to want raw you should buy an rx insteadbr br it is hard to complain about the accessories in this bundle when they are essentially free however only the sony memory card is a name brand item and at only gb it is far from sonys topoftheline the camera case is secured by a small piece of velcro that i dont trust the tripod is flimsy and not adjustable and probably only useful for indoor tabletop use the battery is generic with unknown quality the card reader and screen protectors are very low quality i wish they had provided fewer accessories that were better quality since i will discard most of these unused but again i cant complain too much when they are essentially free,4587

"I initially got an anti-glare version. It worked really great as anti-glare, but it has a texture that makes the image look a little &#34;fuzzy&#34; which was distracting, and I just could not get used to it. Lynn from Expert Shield followed up on my order and I told her how I had felt, and she sent me a clear version of the protector, free of charge! The clear one is really great! It not only protects the screen, but also is resistant to fingerprint smudges, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Too bad the anti-glare version didn't quite work out for me for this particular camera. I think it would work better on a smaller, &#34;less serious&#34; camera which you don't use manually focus with (as opposed to just relying on auto focus and point and shoot).

"Think about this - this is a $220 camera. For the price, you get a real compact camera with HD video capability.<br /><br />Camera review:<br />1) Great size. It's amazing they are able to cram everything on something this small.<br />2) Great weight. It is real light and not a drag in my pocket when I'm wearing shorts or khaki pants.<br />3) The LCD screen is good. 2.5 inch is more than you need to do quick reviews, deal with the settings, etc.<br />4) The viewfinder is quite small but who uses that for point and shoot cameras anyway.<br />5) Buttons - no problems with using the buttons or the zoom knob. I have large hands and can navigate pretty easy.<br />6) Quiet - the motor is noticeably quieter than my old Canon SD600.<br />7) Picture quality - excellent as always. I tend to shoot in normal mode with either 12 or 8MP and the quality looks great. This is a point and shoot so you are not going to get vibrant pictures as you do with a DSLR. However the quality is real good so I have no complaints here.<br />8) Zoom - I like the 3x zoom. No problems. I think the digital zoom is okay but then it's not always good on any point and shoot.<br /><br />Video review:<br />1) Great video. It outputs in 720P HD quality. Nice look and feel when viewing on a computer or on tv. HDMI port is a bonus on the camera.<br />2) Only drawback is you can't optically zoom while filming. But then think about the size of the camera - so plan your shots accordingly before filming. You'll get good video clips for the web to share. Not going to produce an oscar-winning film with this :)<br /><br />Overall:<br />What else can I or anyone else say? Great camera for all the features offered for $220. I love the color, red, too. Nice to have a different color than the same old silver or black boring colors.<br /><br />If you are curious about the quality of pictures or video, go to Vimeo or Flicr and do search for SD780.

"I have used and tested more Ethernet cables than I can remember and there is no question, all Ethernet cables are not created equally.<br /><br />Typically any device requiring an Ethernet cable will come with one in the packaging - it will work (usually).  A good comparison is those cables are much like an old car - it should get you there, whereas this cable is like a high end sports car - it will get you there lightning fast, without failure.<br /><br />This Cat8 is thicker than some due to the shielding within and additional insulation.  The connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug.  The connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivity.<br /><br />This Cat8 Ethernet Cable is 50’ long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your TV or gaming system into your router.  So many of us stream programs and movies via our TV and there is no comparison in speed between a WiFi connection and a wired connection.  For gamers, it is absolutely the way to go - do away with all lag caused by your WiFi by connecting directly to your router.<br /><br />You will not find a better 50’ Ethernet Cable - this is really a top of the line Ethernet cable that you’ll love.<br /><br />This is a purchase that you’ll never regret.",5.0,i have used and tested more ethernet cables than i can remember and there is no question all ethernet cables are not created equallybr br typically any device requiring an ethernet cable will come with one in the packaging it will work usually a good comparison is those cables are much like an old car it should get you there whereas this cable is like a high end sports car it will get you there lightning fast without failurebr br this cat is thicker than some due to the shielding within and additional insulation the connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug the connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivitybr br this cat ethernet cable is long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your tv or gaming system into your router so many of us stream programs and movies via our tv and there is no comparison in speed between a wifi connection and a wired connection for gamers it is absolutely the way to go do away with all lag caused by your wifi by connecting directly to your routerbr br you will not find a better ethernet cable this is really a top of the line ethernet cable that youll lovebr br this is a purchase that youll never regret,1335

"I totally love this case. I spent sometime online researching for a good case for my 2015 Macbook Pro with Retina Display. There were three that I picked from. One is of course this one, another one is the iBenzer, and the third one is the Kuzy (not sure if I spell it right). I first eliminated the iBenzer model even when it has the color I want (darker black, TopCase's black is more like dark gray) because the four foots on the back are white colors, which look so ugly and don't match the case, and they feel so cheap. Then I eliminated Kuzy's model (it has a even better black model that looks so much like navy blue color) because the foots are cheap and seem easy to break (just as what other reviewers have reported). I chose the TopCase model and gave it a try. When I received it, I was impressed by its quality (though the color could be darker and more black rather than gray for my black model). It feels sturdy and soft. Not very fingerprint magnet actually. Even when you actually see some fingerprints, you can easily wipe them out with your &#34;fingers.&#34; The color is ok, the material is great, the foots are sturdy and do not look and feel cheap.

I love that it's truly wireless. You can leave plugged in or move from room to room. The battery is rechargeable and will hold the charge for up to 6 hours. You can also play soothing lullabies for your baby, change the light colors, and even dress it up (you have to purchase your own accessories to do this, however it's very cool)!! The monitor also sends alerts if there are movements and you can set up as you wish. Using the app and installation is literally a piece of cake! I really wish I had come across this baby monitor sooner as it is the best I have seen! The only thing is that the volume is very quiet when you want to communicate with baby. I am assuming this is done on purpose so it doesn't startle or scare your little one. Also, there is about a 2-3 second delay from real time.

The best purchase I brought. I had to get it cuz someone was knocking on my door and touching the door knob. It was like 3 times. So I got a motion alarm that sounds off if anybody trys to break in and with this door knob alarm it works well with it. If anybody touches my door knob or gets close to my door both alarms sounds off loud. It woke me up a couple of times. There are two different sounds and a switch to turn it off if is annoying. I tell you no regrets. The thing is you have to unscrew the lid to put the batteries in. So get a little screw driver since the screws are tiny. Is ok since is worth the effort to be safe. My neighbors hear it too.

"My partner is using this to make his iPad his primary computer, and is very happy. Bought one for a family member,and it also enhanced her use of the iPad. Plan to get one myself, now that white ones are out to match my iPad. No issues with slipping strip that others have complained about. Have to insert the iPad properly. only negative is that I will have to give up my flip back Targus cover/stand when carrying this as a cover, and need a slip case to put them in. The Crown craft case works well.<br /><br />Update 6/2015<br />Have been using the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard cover since 2012, when I received one as a gift. It changed my use of the iPad dramatically, it is now close to a laptop replacement much of the time. Now 3 years into it, it is wearing out. The iPad falls out backward, dangerously so, I have to be sure I don't leave it near the edge of a table lest it fall to the floor. I have always carried or packed the iPad with keyboard cover in an envelope case, and the only damage sustained was when it dropped out of the case to the floor. I do know someone who broke hers when it dropped off of the cover. Haven't put any skin covering on the iPad or case back, the iPad looks good the back of the keyboard a bit worn. The magnetic closure works well enough to position the closed case on the iPad, but I would not say it is strong enough to trust to stay closed.I can't see any magnet holding the iPad into the cover. Although I have been looking for other options, I probably will bite the bullet and get another one of these soon, as it seems to be the best combination of size, weight, usability and protection. Wouldn't consider going without a keyboard again.",5.0,my partner is using this to make his ipad his primary computer and is very happy bought one for a family memberand it also enhanced her use of the ipad plan to get one myself now that white ones are out to match my ipad no issues with slipping strip that others have complained about have to insert the ipad properly only negative is that i will have to give up my flip back targus coverstand when carrying this as a cover and need a slip case to put them in the crown craft case works wellbr br update br have been using the logitech ultrathin keyboard cover since when i received one as a gift it changed my use of the ipad dramatically it is now close to a laptop replacement much of the time now years into it it is wearing out the ipad falls out backward dangerously so i have to be sure i dont leave it near the edge of a table lest it fall to the floor i have always carried or packed the ipad with keyboard cover in an envelope case and the only damage sustained was when it dropped out of the case to the floor i do know someone who broke hers when it dropped off of the cover havent put any skin covering on the ipad or case back the ipad looks good the back of the keyboard a bit worn the magnetic closure works well enough to position the closed case on the ipad but i would not say it is strong enough to trust to stay closedi cant see any magnet holding the ipad into the cover although i have been looking for other options i probably will bite the bullet and get another one of these soon as it seems to be the best combination of size weight usability and protection wouldnt consider going without a keyboard again,1631

"This is SO adorable and so easy to use! It took me less than 5 minutes to follow the instructions and apply this vinyl sticker to my MacBook! These would actually be cute on ANY computer (or, any other project like a picture frame, furniture, mirror, clipboard, etc) and is so easy you can change them up whenever you get the whim. There are no bubbles and it is heavy duty vinyl that sticks well to the surface. The decal was shipped in a large rigid cardboard package to keep it from being damaged and also included a detailed instruction sheet.  There is a cut out of the Apple logo but the decal is there in case you decide you want to use it on something else it is a full mandala.<br /><br />As I was aligning the pattern to the Apple logo on my MacBook I realized I was slightly off in judgement and was able to easily pull it off and reapply it in the right spot.  Definitely better than other brands I've used!  The design and quality are great, you get what you pay for!

"I got into the Meross ecosystem about 6 months ago when I installed the Meross smart garage devices for my two garage doors. Ever since I’ve been delighted with everything they offer. So when I saw they had this smart power strip available, I had to try it. It has been a great purchase and fit my needs nicely.<br />To start, make no mistake, it is larger than your typical (non-smart) power strip, but that’s the trade off for the additional functionality. And really,.. it’s not THAT big. I will say though that it does seem to be built well. The four outlets are individually controllable by app or voice assistant, but the four USB ports are controlled as a group. Not a problem for me, but worth noting. I’ll also mention that the outlets themselves emit an audible ‘click’ when turning on or off, but the USB’s are silent. Again, not an issue, but worth mentioning. Getting it paired with Alexa was easy enough, but I did have a slight problem with it trying to default to Apple Home Kit instead of Alexa. I’m not sure if that’s an issue with this device or Alexa. In any case, it worked fine after a few minutes.<br />Overall I’m very pleased and I’m looking forward to other new Meross products!",5.0,i got into the meross ecosystem about months ago when i installed the meross smart garage devices for my two garage doors ever since ive been delighted with everything they offer so when i saw they had this smart power strip available i had to try it it has been a great purchase and fit my needs nicelybr to start make no mistake it is larger than your typical nonsmart power strip but thats the trade off for the additional functionality and really its not that big i will say though that it does seem to be built well the four outlets are individually controllable by app or voice assistant but the four usb ports are controlled as a group not a problem for me but worth noting ill also mention that the outlets themselves emit an audible click when turning on or off but the usbs are silent again not an issue but worth mentioning getting it paired with alexa was easy enough but i did have a slight problem with it trying to default to apple home kit instead of alexa im not sure if thats an issue with this device or alexa in any case it worked fine after a few minutesbr overall im very pleased and im looking forward to other new meross products,1153

"I originally bought the Mirage Omnipolar surrounds + the Mirage S8 (100 watts) for my finished basement thinking that the 100 watt sub would be enough...for acoustical reference, my basement is 1000 sq. ft, has carpet and is drywalled on the walls and ceiling...anyway, the surrounds are phenomenal and but the sub was not powerful enough to fill the room with sufficient bass.  I am primarily a music listener, and while the S8 did a fine job reproducing musically, it petered out once the volume crept up a little.  I could tell the cone was giving it all it had and there was plenty volume left to go on the receiver (Harmon Kardon).  SO...I sold the S8 and did extensive review-searching, price comparison and came to the conclusion that the JBL 12 was the way to go...and boy was I right.  This sub MORE than adequately fills the 1000 sq. ft. with clean, clear, tight bass at any volume.  It is NOT a club sub...it is not boomy, it doesn't reverb, etc.  It simply reproduces music accurately (and this is on day one when the thing hasn't even been ""burnt"" in) and asks for more.  It will shake your pictures, walls, windows and anything else prone to rattling, so batten down the hatches and buy this thing.  You can't do better for the price....actually, the S8 was $200 more than this sub and this sub begins to shine where the S8 raises the white flag.",5.0,i originally bought the mirage omnipolar surrounds the mirage s watts for my finished basement thinking that the watt sub would be enoughfor acoustical reference my basement is sq ft has carpet and is drywalled on the walls and ceilinganyway the surrounds are phenomenal and but the sub was not powerful enough to fill the room with sufficient bass i am primarily a music listener and while the s did a fine job reproducing musically it petered out once the volume crept up a little i could tell the cone was giving it all it had and there was plenty volume left to go on the receiver harmon kardon soi sold the s and did extensive reviewsearching price comparison and came to the conclusion that the jbl was the way to goand boy was i right this sub more than adequately fills the sq ft with clean clear tight bass at any volume it is not a club subit is not boomy it doesnt reverb etc it simply reproduces music accurately and this is on day one when the thing hasnt even been burnt in and asks for more it will shake your pictures walls windows and anything else prone to rattling so batten down the hatches and buy this thing you cant do better for the priceactually the s was more than this sub and this sub begins to shine where the s raises the white flag,1262

"What a great little BIG gadget. I used it to turn my old VHS cassettes into digital format, no more long waiting to rewind those tapes. Great thing is this supports stereo sound so you can also record sound devices like old turntables and digitize that lost record impossible to find anywhere else. Wish it also had separate audio out port but for the price, loving it. Ive seen something similar at the local store only in a wire concept and it costs near 50 bucks! Forget it. I knew amazon was way to go. Worth the little wait. All you need is to have a spare USB charger (I used i believe 500mAh charger, enough for it to operate at 5Volts) along with RCA and hdmi cable.<br />Picture is clear, well as long as your RCA device is crystal noise-less lol But you will be satisfied and fyi this wont keep 4:3 aspect ratio, itll convert the picture into 16:9 either 720 or 1080p by stretching, which will highlight any picture deformities or artifacts even more since the source resolution is 480i or, 240p. I preferred 720 for archival conversion and overall results are satisfactory.

"My mac died. It took some data with it. Not much, but I was annoyed.<br /><br />I guess I could have gotten the icloud, or a time machine thingy. Effort/money. Bah.<br /><br />My mac cost 2000$ and lasted 6 years, 333 dollars a year. If this chromebook lasts 2 years that'll be 125 a year, and I can throw it in the trash and not lose any data since it uses the google cloud idrive jobby. Did I mention the free google drive space? That comes with it. You cannot beat this price, people!<br /><br />Here's a list of reasons it is superior to my old laptop, in no particular order.<br />- it's lighter. My work laptop weighs so much more, this thing is not noticable.<br />- it's (thermally) cooler<br />- I can hook the hdmi up to my TV and watch netflix<br />- the battery seems to last a long time<br />- no caps lock key, i've always hated the caps lock.<br />- no 'f' keys. ""F""- them! What is ""F4""? A worthless computer shibboleth for lording over users and their ignorant comrades. There are dedicated keys for windowing, and other settings.<br />- The keystrokes feel wonderful. In fairness apple switched to these keys.<br />- no optical drive. I don't need that any more.<br />- no need to hook up my phone to get photos. I push them into the google drive when I take them. They are available whenever I open the chromebook lid.<br />- The trackpad is .. I dunno, supple. flicking around, clicking and right clicking are so nice. I hate the dell trackpads more than ever.<br />- There's no such thing as crapware on this thing.<br /><br />Here's a list of CONS!<br />- google docs doesn't keep the cursor in the right position if you ctrl+ (zoom) the window. Pretty bush league!!<br />- If you open a document in gdocs, it opens a google drive window. Then clicking the document opens another gdoc window. Three windows! Duh.<br /><br />Since these cons only have to do with google docs, I can still give this thing 5 stars. The audio jack is a bit stiff when I tried [un]plugging a std 1/4 inch tip stereo headphone in. Is that a problem? No.<br /><br />Wait, I thought of a con.<br />- you can't see a calendar by clicking on the time. You get dumped into the settings interface for picking your damn time zone. Stick a freaking calendar on that thing google!

How do you get 100% security for an area WITHOUT spending a fortune and doing a lot of expensive wiring? Once I got this camera installed, I haven't given it a second thought. I get instant notifications on my smartphone, with every movement in the protected area. The daytime pics are high resolution and crystal clear. The night time pics are almost as clear, with the IR lighting provided by the camera. You can record both locally to your phone AND the camera (with a micro-SD card inserted) as well as cloud storage (for a fee). The pic I included shows how sharp the detail is. You can even see across the street, with perfect clarity! The camera is really easy to set up, with the solar panel (no external power source required).

"I bought two different brands of drive recorders for my vehicles. I bought this one, and I bought the Apeman C420D. Granted it costs a couple more dollars, I am blown away by how vastly superior the Kingslim D2 is compared to the Apeman.<br /><br />Firstly, the video/picture quality is outstanding on the Kingslim. It’s crystal clear on both the front and rear cameras. Even when moving at high speeds, there is no blur or bounce to the recording. At night, the Kingslim is still amazingly clear compared to the Apeman. The Apeman records terrible footage in low/no light. I have angled my rear camera upwards rather than facing the ground (as a back-up camera would be angled) so that I can record license plates/road ragers of vehicles behind me, and I am able to read the license plates/see the driver almost as clearly as I am able to see from the front camera.<br /><br />Secondly, the setup was fairly easy, and I think anyone could do it themselves. All you have to do is run the wires through your trim to the lighter socket and back of your vehicle, and depending on if internal or external mounting your rear camera, through the back of your vehicle. You can also splice the wire to your reverse light wire, which will turn the camera system into a back-up camera. I decided not to do this because you can just instead change the front camera’s screen to the rear camera’s feed and use it that way temporarily.<br /><br />Lastly, and most importantly, the customer service. I had an issue with the parking sensor and headlight sensor on my Apeman C420D and contacted support about it. All they could tell me was that those features were made that way and were functioning properly, and that if I didn’t like it to just turn them off.<br /><br />I’ve had zero issues with my Kingslim so far, so the only interaction with their customer service was a letter that they sent me (I was surprised by that, as it’s usually just an email), thanking me for my purchase. This shows me the difference between how Apeman sees their customers and how Kingslim appreciates us.<br /><br />All in all, you will not be disappointed in this camera. It is exactly as advertised!",5.0,i bought two different brands of drive recorders for my vehicles i bought this one and i bought the apeman cd granted it costs a couple more dollars i am blown away by how vastly superior the kingslim d is compared to the apemanbr br firstly the videopicture quality is outstanding on the kingslim its crystal clear on both the front and rear cameras even when moving at high speeds there is no blur or bounce to the recording at night the kingslim is still amazingly clear compared to the apeman the apeman records terrible footage in lowno light i have angled my rear camera upwards rather than facing the ground as a backup camera would be angled so that i can record license platesroad ragers of vehicles behind me and i am able to read the license platessee the driver almost as clearly as i am able to see from the front camerabr br secondly the setup was fairly easy and i think anyone could do it themselves all you have to do is run the wires through your trim to the lighter socket and back of your vehicle and depending on if internal or external mounting your rear camera through the back of your vehicle you can also splice the wire to your reverse light wire which will turn the camera system into a backup camera i decided not to do this because you can just instead change the front cameras screen to the rear cameras feed and use it that way temporarilybr br lastly and most importantly the customer service i had an issue with the parking sensor and headlight sensor on my apeman cd and contacted support about it all they could tell me was that those features were made that way and were functioning properly and that if i didnt like it to just turn them offbr br ive had zero issues with my kingslim so far so the only interaction with their customer service was a letter that they sent me i was surprised by that as its usually just an email thanking me for my purchase this shows me the difference between how apeman sees their customers and how kingslim appreciates usbr br all in all you will not be disappointed in this camera it is exactly as advertised,2079

"NOTE: If you have an older person to give a gift who reads, this would be a good choice. The lighting is easy on the eyes, print can be adjusted for size, and it's easy to turn pages and bookmark.  Personal advice is to help them get started with setting up for Amazon and Library, let them do the hands on selections and set up while there to help only if needed.  It's so much easier to hold than a heavier book especially if you get the leather cover which has a soft texture on the inside making it easier to hold.  I never thought I would buy a reader, but there are a lot of books I don't want to keep that I can read and return.

It is heavy duty and the construction seems to be sturdy and like it will last if not abused badly.<br /><br />DESIGN<br />This is designed for a laptop, but in my case, I can put in a laptop along with plenty of notebooks, books, and smaller papers and documents.  The front pockets are a bit of a hassle to get in and out of, but they are good for small items that you want to take with you but keep secure.<br /><br />HANDLES<br />The handles on this are sturdy and easy to hold, although if the bag is really heavy, they could bite into your hand a bit as there is not cushioning. I don't see it as a big problem in most cases.<br /><br />INSIDE<br />The inside is lined out of decent fabric. It is not top of the line, but it is pretty decent.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This has been the perfect bag for me for my research.  It keeps all of my items handy, has shoulder strap or handles, and is tough and high quality.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This bag is just what I have been looking for.

Many articles expound on the importance of a good center speaker, and they are right.  We always had trouble hearing dialog before, and now that problem is gone.  I also added Polk's PSW10 powered subwoofer, and the combination of these speakers has truly transformed my surround sound from so-so to awesome.

"These are the best bass heavy earbuds that I was searching for. 75t are bass heavy at the same time the overall audio experience is so precise and clear.  I actually don’t know what would I do if I lost them or something wrong happens to these! Using them for the past 2 years and I felt I should write a review for my 75t. You won’t like any other earbuds, once you use 75t.

"There were some games that were unplayable when more than 10 people are on the screen.  I thought I needed to update my gfx card (evga gtx 680 superclocked).  Nope, turns out that the gpu's perfectly fine and can play in max settings 120hz (1920x 1080 in 3d) almost without a hiccup.  I probably won't need to upgrade it for another 3-5 year or so (but I'll probably get the maxwell because I hate being out of date).<br /><br />All I did was replace my amd fx8150 (and obviously the mobo).  Wow, smooth as a baby, no more studder.  I guess it turns out that the fx8150 was the bottleneck (oc'd to 4ghz).  I thought cpus were better than that nowadays?  I guess not.  For the last 10 years I've been AMD all the way.  But now I guess I'm going to be an intel fanboy. Okay, I suppose AMD is still the best bang for the buck hands down.  But if you want top raw performance, AMD won't give it to you.  I heard the fx9000 series were disappointing and not that much better so I took a chance on this 4930k which was cheaper, I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-No pins, wow when did that happen?  I was worried because instead of pins, the cpu and mobo only had tiny gold bumps.  I'm not too fond of connections that don't lock in, but I also don't like accidentally bending pins. I guess these guys know what they're doing.<br /><br />-4.2ghz without even trying to oc.  like seriously.  I just put turboost on auto and it maxes out at 4.2ghz when it needs to and comes back down to 1.5ghz on idle.  Well I'm sure I probably did something while stumbling through the bios.<br /><br />-Processor speed debate aside, this thing is the fastest cpu I've owned.  I probably wont need to upgrade until they come up with quantum cpus.<br /><br />-Very cool, not as hot as the other intel processors I've had in the distant past.  Also I suck at putting on thermal paste, can't ever figure it out.  So I'm glad this runs cold.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Its too sexy, I caved in and bought it.

"I've gone through several indoor antennaes and even tried one that went outside the window.  I read the reviews on here before I decided to try this one.  I am more than satisfied with the performance of this product.  My problem is I live in a rural area and the TV towers from my computer room won't come in properly.  I couldn't get the CBS channel at all before and my ABC and NBC channels were coming in intermittently in the 70's and 80's range.  As soon as I cut the on switch on this science-fiction-looking antennae, it jumped up to a steady 100% on both the ABC and NBC channels.  CBS is registering at 76% and is not intermittent, but at least this antennae would pick it up.  The others wouldn't even find it.  My other room gets CBS at 86 to 90%, so I can get it in there if I really needed it.  I am hooked into a Dish Network receiver system and get all local channels that way, but I like having the over-the-air capability as well, which is what this antenna is providing.  My NBC over-the-air has a channel that shows the live weather radar.  My satellite doesn't provide this channel so this is the only way I can view it.  If you are looking for an inside antennae to get a hard-to-reach channel, if there is a better one out there, I haven't found it.

"The Apple Care Protection Plan offered by Amazon is the same as it is from the Apple Store -- only cheaper. In the past I'd bought the AppleCare Protection Plan from Amazon and installed it at home without a hitch. However, this time I had a problem, and had to take it to the Apple Store for help. I printed out my Amazon Invoice and brought it with me, and the tech installed it for me with no problem. I suspect that there are probably bootleg copies of the plan floating around, and Apple may be extra-sensitive about installations.  However, since I had proof of purchase from an authorized reseller (Amazon), they were happy to install it (if you live too far from a Apple store, they likely would talk you through it on the phone as long as you have POP. And many people purchase from Amazon and install at home with no problem -- this is not a universal issue.)<br />Remember to save all your paperwork, and purchase and install AppleCare before the first year is up.  Apple used to be more flexible  -- you could walk in with an 18-mo old Mac with a major problem, and they'd sell you AppleCare and cover it -- but not anymore.  And Apple isn't what it used to be -- major hardware problems crop up in the first two years  with far more frequency than they used to (after failing on four attempts to repair my MacBook Pro, Apple actually had to replace it)-- so AppleCare should be considered the cost of doing business, and not an &#34;extra&#34;.",5.0,the apple care protection plan offered by amazon is the same as it is from the apple store only cheaper in the past id bought the applecare protection plan from amazon and installed it at home without a hitch however this time i had a problem and had to take it to the apple store for help i printed out my amazon invoice and brought it with me and the tech installed it for me with no problem i suspect that there are probably bootleg copies of the plan floating around and apple may be extrasensitive about installations however since i had proof of purchase from an authorized reseller amazon they were happy to install it if you live too far from a apple store they likely would talk you through it on the phone as long as you have pop and many people purchase from amazon and install at home with no problem this is not a universal issuebr remember to save all your paperwork and purchase and install applecare before the first year is up apple used to be more flexible you could walk in with an mo old mac with a major problem and theyd sell you applecare and cover it but not anymore and apple isnt what it used to be major hardware problems crop up in the first two years with far more frequency than they used to after failing on four attempts to repair my macbook pro apple actually had to replace it so applecare should be considered the cost of doing business and not an extra,1388
"I only have this tablet for about a week but reading off it is a pleasure; the 8&#34; is just the perfect size for me. It's not too big or too small like the 7 or 10 inch tablets. It is a little heavier than I expected but that makes it feel less fragile. I bought a cover for it so it is more protected from scratches now and I can watch movies and read without holding it. I had come from a Samsung that finally died on me and I reluctantly decided to try the Fire HD tablet because the price is so amazing. I am pleasantly surprised. It plays movies beautifully and the books are read so easily now. The display is clear with nice color and so far it runs smooth and fast. I needed it basically to periodically check my email, read books, watch movies, play some simple games and the bonus is the tablet is Amazon of which I am a Prime member so it is all right there for me anytime I need to shop or browse videos or music or books. I am really loving this tablet. It does what I need it to do and it does it well. I find I don't actually need the ridiculously priced tablets as this does much of those but with an incredibly low price. I don't know how it will work later on, maybe in a year or so but then, I don't know how the more expensive ones will either. If you're not into trendy things just because they have a &#34;name&#34; among the crowd... then I would absolutely recommend this Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet... oh, and I love Alexa. I have an Echo Dot and this is just terrific to use in other rooms. I do suggest a good bluetooth as the speaker is not very loud. If you're not sure about this tablet, give it a try anyway. You might be pleasantly surprised!",5.0,i only have this tablet for about a week but reading off it is a pleasure the is just the perfect size for me its not too big or too small like the or inch tablets it is a little heavier than i expected but that makes it feel less fragile i bought a cover for it so it is more protected from scratches now and i can watch movies and read without holding it i had come from a samsung that finally died on me and i reluctantly decided to try the fire hd tablet because the price is so amazing i am pleasantly surprised it plays movies beautifully and the books are read so easily now the display is clear with nice color and so far it runs smooth and fast i needed it basically to periodically check my email read books watch movies play some simple games and the bonus is the tablet is amazon of which i am a prime member so it is all right there for me anytime i need to shop or browse videos or music or books i am really loving this tablet it does what i need it to do and it does it well i find i dont actually need the ridiculously priced tablets as this does much of those but with an incredibly low price i dont know how it will work later on maybe in a year or so but then i dont know how the more expensive ones will either if youre not into trendy things just because they have a name among the crowd then i would absolutely recommend this amazon fire hd tablet oh and i love alexa i have an echo dot and this is just terrific to use in other rooms i do suggest a good bluetooth as the speaker is not very loud if youre not sure about this tablet give it a try anyway you might be pleasantly surprised,1610
"I got these for working around the house, wearing around work and going for walks. The cups are super squishy and comfy, they sit outside my ears which is ideal to not put pressure on my piercings. I mostly control them with my phone, but the buttons are easy enough to figure out. Even without using the noise cancelling button I can barely hear people though they still try to talk to me. The headphones are a little uncomfortable if you put them around your neck, but that's not what they're meant for. There is a HUGE nonremovale L and R on the corresponding ear cups which is odd but not terrible, you will always know what side goes where. After nearly 3 months of about 5 days weekly use the fabric is pulling up from the cup part, but it should be glueable.",5.0,i got these for working around the house wearing around work and going for walks the cups are super squishy and comfy they sit outside my ears which is ideal to not put pressure on my piercings i mostly control them with my phone but the buttons are easy enough to figure out even without using the noise cancelling button i can barely hear people though they still try to talk to me the headphones are a little uncomfortable if you put them around your neck but thats not what theyre meant for there is a huge nonremovale l and r on the corresponding ear cups which is odd but not terrible you will always know what side goes where after nearly months of about days weekly use the fabric is pulling up from the cup part but it should be glueable,746

"Build is solid. It is larger than a phone, by a lot, I would say with included case about 4x the thickness of a Google Pixel. It sounds noticeably better than a phone as well. This is why you rip your music at high quality and spend decent money on headphones. The UI is a bit different than a traditional phone set up, that's fine, this isn't a phone. For the price, I think it's great, compared to other players closer to the $1k mark. If I had a wishlist, it would be to add a second microSD slot. And maybe software similar to iTunes that can organize your music/podcasts. Other than that, it's a good purchase.",5.0,build is solid it is larger than a phone by a lot i would say with included case about x the thickness of a google pixel it sounds noticeably better than a phone as well this is why you rip your music at high quality and spend decent money on headphones the ui is a bit different than a traditional phone set up thats fine this isnt a phone for the price i think its great compared to other players closer to the k mark if i had a wishlist it would be to add a second microsd slot and maybe software similar to itunes that can organize your musicpodcasts other than that its a good purchase,590

"I'm always on the hunt for a solid & affordable tablet/cell phone stand.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my endless quest has left me with my share of duds.<br /><br />Many are constructed of cheap plastic & easily break. Or don't have a sturdy base & topple over. Or are just not thoughtfully designed for their intended purpose.<br /><br />So when this stand by FCXJTU (terrible name, BTW) arrived in its nameless (other than ""Lifting Folding Desktop Bracket""), generic white box, I had no expectations that this guy would be any different than his predecessors.<br /><br />Man, was I glad to be wrong!<br /><br />This compact stand is very well designed & executed.<br /><br />It's constructed from combination of plastic & metal elements with silicone grips in all the right places (on the device cradle & on the bottom of the base).<br /><br />Although, I would like to see the bottom grips a littler more aggressively ""grippy.""<br /><br />They allowed the stand to slip across the desk when applying somewhat decent pressure.<br /><br />However, this was not a deal breaker as I was purposely pushing fairly hard. Under normal use this won't be an issue.<br /><br />The base of the stand is well weighted to keep your device safely in place. It doesn't slip or slide while typing, swiping, using a stylus or while adjusting angles, heights, etc...<br /><br />The cradle (where your device sits) has folding feet that automatically pop out to support your phone or tablet.<br /><br />The top of the cradle adjusts in size so you can customize to the height to your electronics.<br /><br />One HUGE plus of this stand is the actual mounting arm.<br /><br />It's made (at least the outer shell) of a metal or alloy. There are real screws that hold it together! (not rivets or plastic clips).<br /><br />The arm extends out to twice the length of its normal size. It ratchets up or down precisely allowing your to make  ""micro"" adjustments to the arm height. Very nice!<br /><br />The joints (where the arm attaches to the base & where the arm attaches to the cradle) are VERY tight.<br /><br />This is a big deal!<br /><br />If you've dealt with crappy stands, the you know that if the joints are all sloppy & loosey goosey, then your device sinks over time.<br /><br />This little guy is hanging in there even when holding a Surface Go in a Kensignton Blackebelt case with keyboard attached.<br /><br />That's OVER 2 lbs of weight & the stand doesn't budge.<br /><br />The last thing I will say about this little gem is its size.<br /><br />He folds up to 4.4""L x 2.6W"". That's smaller in height than an iPhone SE (2016) (see pic).<br /><br />And it weighs in at just under 7 ounces.<br /><br />In comparison, a Samsung Galaxy S9+ with a polycarbonate hard shell case weighs around 9 ounces.<br /><br />So this stand is definitely very portable.<br /><br />To sum things up, I have to say this guy is a for sure winner.<br /><br />The price point ($16.99 w/ Prime at the date of this review) is right on. It's compact & portable so can easily be slipped in to your pocket, bag or backpack. And has a sturdy build that allows adjustment into dozens of positions to support a variety of electronics without slipping, sagging or sliding.<br /><br />An all around sweet deal!",5.0,im always on the hunt for a solid affordable tabletcell phone standbr br unfortunately my endless quest has left me with my share of dudsbr br many are constructed of cheap plastic easily break or dont have a sturdy base topple over or are just not thoughtfully designed for their intended purposebr br so when this stand by fcxjtu terrible name btw arrived in its nameless other than lifting folding desktop bracket generic white box i had no expectations that this guy would be any different than his predecessorsbr br man was i glad to be wrongbr br this compact stand is very well designed executedbr br its constructed from combination of plastic metal elements with silicone grips in all the right places on the device cradle on the bottom of the basebr br although i would like to see the bottom grips a littler more aggressively grippybr br they allowed the stand to slip across the desk when applying somewhat decent pressurebr br however this was not a deal breaker as i was purposely pushing fairly hard under normal use this wont be an issuebr br the base of the stand is well weighted to keep your device safely in place it doesnt slip or slide while typing swiping using a stylus or while adjusting angles heights etcbr br the cradle where your device sits has folding feet that automatically pop out to support your phone or tabletbr br the top of the cradle adjusts in size so you can customize to the height to your electronicsbr br one huge plus of this stand is the actual mounting armbr br its made at least the outer shell of a metal or alloy there are real screws that hold it together not rivets or plastic clipsbr br the arm extends out to twice the length of its normal size it ratchets up or down precisely allowing your to make micro adjustments to the arm height very nicebr br the joints where the arm attaches to the base where the arm attaches to the cradle are very tightbr br this is a big dealbr br if youve dealt with crappy stands the you know that if the joints are all sloppy loosey goosey then your device sinks over timebr br this little guy is hanging in there even when holding a surface go in a kensignton blackebelt case with keyboard attachedbr br thats over lbs of weight the stand doesnt budgebr br the last thing i will say about this little gem is its sizebr br he folds up to l x w thats smaller in height than an iphone se see picbr br and it weighs in at just under ouncesbr br in comparison a samsung galaxy s with a polycarbonate hard shell case weighs around ouncesbr br so this stand is definitely very portablebr br to sum things up i have to say this guy is a for sure winnerbr br the price point w prime at the date of this review is right on its compact portable so can easily be slipped in to your pocket bag or backpack and has a sturdy build that allows adjustment into dozens of positions to support a variety of electronics without slipping sagging or slidingbr br an all around sweet deal,2954

I haven`t had my S10e for very long so I don`t know all the tricks yet. I upgraded from a Galaxy S6 Active. I like to draw and I`m hoping to figure out how to do this on my phone. This little pen does well with swyping which I do when texting. It helps me alot. Usually when I swype some really weird words manage to get on the screen but since I`ve been using this little pen things are looking alot better! I get alot of laughs at some of the things I`ve texted to my family and friends because of swyping. The phone decides to change what I`ve swyped to what it thinks I`ve wanted to swype and that can be hilarious and sometimes embarrassing. Not with this pen. It is more defined than my big fingers and it swypes what I want it to swype. No more embarrassing texts! It comes with two tops. One just a regular pen top and the other is a stylus top like the soft rubber tips you buy. Then you get the charger which plugs in to the top of the pen when there isn`t a tip on it. the tip are magnetic and they stay on very well. I`ve had no problem at all with one falling off. It`s a very strong magnet. It also comes with a glove that covers your ring finger and pinky so they don`t hinder you when using it. I love the pen. It`s white and classy looking. Everything is white except the glove. When I learn more about my phone I`m going to have a grand ol` time with this pen drawing and doing some real art!

"This Apple Wireless Keyboard is a great choice for your Mac computer. While quite expensive for a keyboard, it has excellent build-quality, excellent functionality, and excellent durability/longevity.<br /><br />While I do not love every aspect of Apple, the quality of their hardware is a major reason I have purchased so many of their products over the past 15 years. While no company that produces products on a mass-production scale is perfect here, Apple generally produces hardware of exceptional quality, and the hardware components they produce ‘play nice’ with each other. Whether or not this Apple Wireless Keyboard is worth the price premium is a personal decision made by the individual buyer. Still, I can attest first-hand to the quality of this keyboard.<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />DESCRIPTION<br />The Apple Wireless Keyboard is a compact design made from an aluminum ‘unibody’ frame and white plastic keys (in other words, the frame is a 1-piece aluminum design.) The keyboard has an almost identical layout to that used on Apple’s MacBook Pro line. The key sizes themselves, as well as the locations & spacing are almost identical. Using two AA batteries***, this keyboard connects to a computer via a Bluetooth connection. The keyboard does not have any ports on it and so there is no way of using this in a traditional wired fashion. It is not LED backlit like many of Apple’s other products.<br /><br />Apple’s current model wireless keyboard is the A1314 MC184LL/B. Previously it was the A1314 MC184LL/A. If I recall correctly, the only differences between the two are that the F3 and F4 keys have been updated to show different images to reflect OS X’s change to the Mission Control and Launchpad. (But don’t quote me here as I am not 100% positive.) This listing is for the 'A' version meaning the F3 and F4 keys contain the older symbols.<br /><br />Setting up this keyboard does not require any installation or additional software. The Bluetooth already built into OS X is what makes the link between the computer and the keyboard. Setting it up is as simple as enabling Bluetooth on the other Apple device, pairing the keyboard with this device, and (optionally) then adjusting keyboard settings. Bluetooth and Keyboard can both be found in the System Preferences.<br /><br />***while estimating battery life is difficult with any keyboard since usage varies as does battery capability, if you use the best NiMH AA out there (which is the eneloop 2100 4th generation NiMH), a year or more on a single charge isn’t an unreasonable figure. (By comparison, lower quality NiMH cells could be closer to a month or less, so there is a lot of variability here.)<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE<br />One reason I really like the MacBook Pro is because it uses a single-piece aluminum frame. Aluminum is strong, lightweight, and great for heat dissipation. The use of an aluminum frame on this keyboard gives it inherent durability that others lack, and it allows a design that is far slimmer than a plastic body (a keyboard this thin in plastic would crack the first time it is dropped.) So this keyboard is strong despite being micro-thin. Given aluminum is very resistant to warping over time and improves structural rigidity, I have found that keyboards I have owned with an aluminum body tend to not just last longer but maintain more consistent performance over time.<br /><br />The keys themselves are, like the MacBook Pro, really well designed. They are a matte white and this finish hides oil reflection from fingerprints, and unlike a glossy finish, it gives your fingers some-but-not-too-much traction. Also like the MacBook Pro, the force required for a keystroke is VERY consistent, and for me this is important as I cannot stand keyboards in which certain keys need more or less force to perform the same as others. The feedback of the keys are also excellent…you know when you have pushed a key, but it does not make a loud or annoying noise. Keys of the same sizes also have identical feedback to each other. The engravings on the keys themselves are durable and I assume this is probably laser engraving because of how well they hold up.<br /><br />While you cannot adjust the elevation, the angle used is a real winner. I think it is very comfortable and functional. Apple also added non-slip material to avoid the issue of sliding, which many angled keyboards suffer from.<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />WHAT I DO NOT LIKE<br />The biggest thing I dislike about this keyboard is the price. It is certainly built to a quality standard that is superior to many other products, but you pay a major price premium for this. This was a gift to me…while I really like it, I am not sure if I would have purchased this myself because there are pretty decent wireless keyboards you can get for under $15.<br /><br />Unlike the MacBook Pro, the Apple Wireless Keyboard does NOT have LED backlighting. The first time I purchased a laptop with backlit keys, I thought it was silly. Now I love it as I find it makes typing easier in low-light situations. For a $70 keyboard, that higher price justifies including this feature. There are decent LED backlit wireless keyboards one can get for under $30-45, and very nice ones once you reach the $70 range.<br /><br />Finally, the inability to use this as a wired keyboard is also frustrating. Apple is known for trying to eliminate as many wires and ports as possible, but sometimes they make things more difficult than less. The Bluetooth link on this keyboard works very well. However, other household devices can interfere with Bluetooth connections, and sometimes you may run out of batteries or come into a situation in which you want the keyboard to be wired (for example, if you need to start a computer in a safe mode, which may disable Bluetooth, or if you need to input a command at an initial startup sequence before the Bluetooth link is active.) Adding a micro USB port would give the user more flexibility, and again at this price I think this should be included.<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Overall, Apple’s Wireless Keyboard is a great keyboard. It has very solid construction, excellent usability, and a strong Bluetooth connection. The biggest single problem with this keyboard is the price. It is a lot of money in a world with many nice wireless keyboards for under half the price of this Apple keyboard. Whether or not this premium keyboard justifies the premium pricing comes down to the individual buyer. However, if you choose to purchase this Apple Wireless Keyboard, I can vouch first-hand to the quality of the design, and I think you will be satisfied with your purchase.<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />SIDE NOTE----BATTERIES – DON’T BUY THE APPLE BATTERIES & CHARGER<br />As for the Apple batteries and charger sold, I would recommend NOT purchasing them. While they are decent cells, superior NiMH AA’s can be purchased for less money. Instead consider purchasing eneloop 4th generation NiMH AA’s (AKA the 2100 series) as they are less expensive and have dramatically improved performance over previous generation NiMH cells (in fact, they outperform even the best of alkaline batteries and now have an equally long shelf-life.)",5.0,this apple wireless keyboard is a great choice for your mac computer while quite expensive for a

"I read through the instructions and got the app downloaded and working, picked a ringtone to find my phone and attached the Tile Pro to my keys.  How cool is this thing!

"One of the issues with some tower cases is the placement of USB ports. Some of the newer cases have USB ports on the front but often these are USB 2.0. Even when there are 3.0 ports on the front of the case it seems there need to be one or two more. AVANTEK's 5.25"" drive bay USB add-on hub adds three USB ports as well as a 2.4A charging port.<br /><br />The hub has two internal plugs. One is for power and one is for the USB bus. Be sure that your case and motherboard can support USB 3.0 and has the proper plugs.<br /><br />Once installed, the three ports are immediately available to the operating system and they work like the other USB ports on the system. The USB speeds are best realized with something like a USB 3.0 storage device like an external hard drive, though USB 1.1 devices like mice and keyboards work just fine on this hub too.<br /><br />What makes this hub interesting is actually the 2.4A charging port. This is very convenient for charging a cell phone, a tablet or similar device. My chosen device for testing chargers is a Magellan Roadmate GPS navigator, which is an ornery device that will not charge when powered on unless using the car charger that came with it. I selected a high-speed USB cable and plugged in my navigator and it charged up quickly when powered off. However, the navigator slowly drained faster than it charged when powered on. This was expected though it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I am especially encouraged at how solid this device is - the ports are securely soldered to the PC board and the board itself is mounted on several posts to the frame which makes it much less likely to flex and ultimately break. I applied some direct pressure to the PC board (not a realistic scenario in use but a good test before installation) and the board really did not flex much at all.<br /><br />I can't find any real issues with this hub. It's a solidly built device, it mounts easily and once connected provides 3 USB ports and a charging port on the front of a computer tower case. It is reasonably priced too which makes it a very good buy.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"This little case fits my Flip Video camera and Fuji EXR perfectly.  I think it should fit any camera that's not bigger than 3"" x 5"" (the measurements of this case).  It's a soft case so it will not protect your camera if someone should accidentally step on it, or should it drop from a high structure onto concrete, but it's still a nice case.  I put my Flip camera in it then decided to see how waterproof it is and ran a little water on it under the faucet.  I don't claim that it will keep your camera perfectly dry in a downpour, but my camera was dry and the inside of the case was dry. I wiped the excess water off with a towel and the case feels dry.  My Flip camera eats AA batteries and the case has a zippered pouch on the front which is great for carrying extra batteries or cards.  It also has a large clip to fasten it to a belt or belt loops which I find very nice.  I had been carrying my Flip in my purse and it simply took up too much room.  Now I can carry my Flip on my hip!  I think this is a very good product, especially for the price.

"Love this little guy.  I take it everywhere.

Swap out, easy to move data around, print stills directly to my Epson printer.<br /><br />2) Batteries, the Zi6 comes with rechargable batteries, actually my Zi6  purchase came with two sets of batteries and one charger.  Batteries life is very good, mine last about 4 days between recharge.<br />3) Zi6 LCD screen size large compared to the Flip screens.<br />4) Great video qualtity, for the device type.<br />5) Zi6 comes with all the cables.<br /><br />I did not work with Flips software, but Kodak software works well.

"This 3'x5' background works well for infants, and toddlers.  I really like the design as it's light in color and doesn't add too much darkness.

"When traveling I didn't always pack a full tripod, and when I did I usually left it behind. I used other mini-tripod types before, and this is is by far the most versatile.

The miniaturized tripod type are more rigid, but still not rigid enough to use in unconventional ways. This tripod seems quite well put together. I can tighten it up, place it on a dashboard of a car and hold it there (granted with a lot of effort) on a bouncing road and the DSLR will not sag. Having the ability to tie it to things with the included Velcro strap proved to be more useful than I thought, and more rigid than the gorillapod-type.

Once all the pieces are put together, it has a very good weight to it, and I don't feel worried at all when I'm adjusting the height and tightening and un-tightening the tension.<br />I searched for the closest thing to photograph on the stand, which was my kindle, and I realized how perfect it was for it!  I originally planned on using this on my desk to hold my phone and iPad , but I now keep it mainly on my bedside table to hold my kindle and phone.

"I truly love these!<br />They are well made and feel strong. They are the comfiest in-ear headphones I have ever worn. The noise-canceling is very impressive.

Treble is sharp, midrange impressively clear.<br />You put them in the case, and they charge up! Even though the case may not be connected to a power supply. The charger in the case does charge quickly.<br /><br />Comfortable, clear sound with no background noise to interfere. I learned a little about how my hearing works with these, I was listening to music while I mowed the lawn and I pushed my hip against the mowers handle.

Big fan of the Garmin. I was in the market for something to replace my old heart monitor strap and decided to go with a smart watch. I didn’t want a smart watch that would drive me crazy - for example I had an Apple Watch at one point and it was just too much info all the time. I just wanted a good smart watch for working out. This fits that bill. I find the heart rate is pretty accurate (lines up with the chest strap and a finger monitor I have) and it has a ton of great features to track any kind of workout you may tackle. It’s also pretty cool looking and very rugged.

"After a week's worth of usage, I am modifying my original review.  I am also providing a comparison of this Sony Sound-bar, to the Sonos Playbar.  I'm doing this as I think the price range of each is similar enough to interest potential buyers in each system.<br /><br />I am rating the Sony Sound-bar as excellent.<br /><br />1.  My Direct TV remote, and my Samsung remote control the volume on the Sound-bar. They also turn it off.  No pairing was needed.<br />2.  Both of the above remotes also turn it on, but since you need the Sony remote for the HDMI link,  you must use the Sony remote when turning the TV on. There are also easily accessible buttons on the Sound-bar, in case you lose the remote.  Once the TV is on, you don't need the Sony remote unless you want to change the optional features such as voice for news, dialog, or music.<br />3.  Bluetooth is a snap.  You use the remote to activate the Bluetooth function.<br /><br />Sonos Playbar vs Sony Sound-bar.<br /><br />For TV only usage.<br /><br />The Sonos cost $ 700, with no subwoofer.  The subwoofer doubles the price.<br />The Sony has a wireless subwoofer.  As a result, the Sony is better as a TV soundbar.<br />I purchased my Sonos as a standalone item, 6 months ago.  If you plan on only buying the Sonos Player, it is not a good value.  The value of the Sonos its for those that intend to have a multi-room Sonos system.  Last month I added the Sonos One in a different room.  The Sonos software is outstanding.  I fully agree with a comment I read a year ago, that the Sonos Playbar is worth $ 350, and the Sonos software is worth $ 350.  The software is a pleasure to use.<br /><br />Both give clear dialog.<br /><br />Winner for TV usage.  Sony Sound-bar by a wide margin.<br /><br />For music usage.<br /><br />No clear winner as each is very different.<br /><br />The Sonos Playbar is connected through your internet.<br />It does not have bluetooth.  That is a big negative.  However, it is always on, and not dependent on any other device. You use your phone, IPad, or other device, as your Sonos remote.  Very simple, with their great app. You can shut off all your other devices and the Sonos will play  all day and all night. You will only need your phone remote to select a new station.<br />It is very easy to change music services on the Sonos.  Once music is on, I just tell Alexa to increase or decrease volume, or shut the music off.  Alexa is incorporated in my Sonos One, and I have the Echo Dot next to my Sonos Playbar in another room.  It is a wireless connection.  You just tell either Alexa which room to play the music in.<br /><br />The Sony Sound-bar has bluetooth.  That is very convenient.  It also has the subwoofer.<br />Excellent music quality.<br /><br />The Sonos Playbar is not competitive with the Sony soundbar, as it doesn't come with a subwoofer. A full fledged Sonos system would cost over $ 2000, and would be awesome. That is beyond my budget.<br /><br />Although I really like both my Sonos devices, on a value basis, I would buy the Sony Sound-bar. The included subwoofer makes the difference. The bluetooth is also more convenient, for playing a few songs.<br /><br />A final note.<br /><br />We prefer the styling of the Sony.  Consider it a miniature Sonos Playbar.<br />It is longer than the Sonos Playbar, but definitely a miniature look.<br />The actual length is 37 inches.  A template is provided for mounting on the wall, but no hardware is available.<br /><br />Important comment.<br /><br />Using the HDMI connection from the cable box, through the Soundbar to the TV and return.  My streaming devices are only providing audio through the TV speaker.  I guess I need to connect an optical cable to get audio through the soundbar on streaming devices.  That should work.<br /><br />Also. I’m thinking of going from Direct TV to Direct TV now when my promo ends.  The latest Apple and Roku devices have HDMI so I would think after removing my cable box, I can connect the HDMI directly through the Soundbar.  The streaming device simply replaces the cable box. That will leave OTA stations only providing audio through the TV speakers.  Need the optical connected for that.  Am I missing something?",5.0,after a weeks worth of usage i am modifying my original review i am also providing a comparison of this sony soundbar to the sonos playbar im doing this as i think the price range of each is similar enough to interest potential buyers in each systembr br i am rating the sony soundbar as excellentbr br my direct tv remote and my samsung remote control the volume on the soundbar they also turn it off no pairing was neededbr both of the above remotes also turn it on but since you need the sony remote for the hdmi link you must use the sony remote when turning the tv on there are also easily accessible buttons on the soundbar in case you lose the remote once the tv is on you dont need the sony remote unless you want to change the optional features such as voice for news dialog or musicbr bluetooth is a snap you use the remote to activate the bluetooth functionbr br sonos playbar vs sony soundbarbr br for tv only usagebr br the sonos cost with no subwoofer the subwoofer doubles the pricebr the sony has a wireless subwoofer as a result the sony is better as a tv soundbarbr i purchased my sonos as a standalone item months ago if you plan on only buying the sonos player it is not a good value the value of the sonos its for those that intend to have a multiroom sonos system last month i added the sonos one in a different room the sonos software is outstanding i fully agree with a comment i read a year ago that the sonos playbar is worth and the sonos software is worth the software is a pleasure to usebr br both give clear dialogbr br winner for tv usage sony soundbar by a wide marginbr br for music usagebr br no clear winner as each is very differentbr br the sonos playbar is connected through your internetbr it does not have bluetooth that is a big negative however it is always on and not dependent on any other device you use your phone ipad or other device as your sonos remote very simple with their great app you can shut off all your other devices and the sonos will play all day and all night you will only need your phone remote to select a new stationbr it is very easy to change music services on the sonos once music is on i just tell alexa to increase or decrease volume or shut the music off alexa is incorporated in my sonos one and i have the echo dot next to my sonos playbar in another room it is a wireless connection you just tell either alexa which room to play the music inbr br the sony soundbar has bluetooth that is very convenient it also has the subwooferbr excellent music qualitybr br the sonos playbar is not competitive with the sony soundbar as it doesnt come with a subwoofer a full fledged sonos system would cost over and would be awesome that is beyond my budgetbr br although i really like both my sonos devices on a value basis i would buy the sony soundbar the included subwoofer makes the difference the bluetooth is also more convenient for playing a few songsbr br a final notebr br we prefer the styling of the sony consider it a miniature sonos playbarbr it is longer than the sonos playbar but definitely a miniature lookbr the actual length is inches a template is provided for mounting on the wall but no hardware is availablebr br important commentbr br using the hdmi connection from the cable box through the soundbar to the tv and return my streaming devices are only providing audio through the tv speaker i guess i need to connect an optical cable to get audio through the soundbar on streaming devices that should workbr br also im thinking of going from direct tv to direct tv now when my promo ends the latest apple and roku devices have hdmi so i would think after removing my cable box i can connect the hdmi directly through the soundbar the streaming device simply replaces the cable box that will leave ota stations only providing audio through the tv speakers need the optical connected for that am i missing something,3901

"Was shocked how fast the charging was.  Pretty lights a bonus & much easier to see that it’s working than the itty bitty battery icon on my phone.  I thought maybe having an older phone, a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 that they wouldn’t work for me, but my phone had finished charging before I could blink practically!  (Granted it was pretty full when I plugged these in, but it finished off so fast I.could only test the1 cord!)  The 2nd showed it was charging so I’m assuming it’ll work as well.<br />The lights were pretty & not bright, IMO.  I’d actually forgotten that they lit up.  I’d needed some new cords & there was an additional discount for ordering the same time as I ordered Listen’s car charger holder, so I added to my order w/o realizing they had these extra features.  Now just hope the phone holder works as brilliantly as these cords.<br />Have only just received, so can’t speak to durability yet, but at least from out the gate, I’m impressed by it’s strong showing & hoping it has the endurance to keep up the good work for some time.  These weren’t the cheapest at $13.99 for a pair = $7. Ea & maybe I got 10% off = 6.30 ea, but I’ve found buying the cheapest doesn’t usually work out.

"Update Aug 2016<br /><br />Verbatim is no longer manufacturing these disks in Singapore or India. Their new facility in the UAE is however now producing good quality disks. As a result I am upgrading the rating here to 5 stars from the former one star.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />Verbatim DL used to be by far the best DL media available. Reliable, stable in storage, and consistent high quality made by Mitsubishi in their Singapore plant, one of the highest quality DVD production plants in the world.<br /><br />Not any more. Verbatim has outsourced a large part of their DL production to a plant in India, and now when you buy this media you have a high chance of getting made in India - this product is poor, often with obvious physical defects in the media like bubbles, holes and foil delaminates.<br /><br />It is possible to still find made in Singapore cakeboxes on store shelves, but if you can't actually read the disk label before buying you are rolling the dice when you buy.<br /><br />It is a real shame Verbatim does not offer the Singapore product as a diferent grade. It would be worth a few extra bucks to get a cakebox that had a 95% success rate vs. the 50% rate the made in India product gives.<br /><br />Verbatim has really gotten a black eye in my book with this stunt.<br /><br />Update: (Dec 17 2014)<br /><br />Well Verbatim is up to it's old tricks, now they are shipping stuff from the United Arab Emirates.

"I had a 10"" Cambridge subwoofer that got moved to my music room leaving a void that was filled with this BIC.<br /><br />For about $75 difference between a Polk 10"", I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />First, it's LARGE. It's more than twice the volume of the 10"" that it replaced.<br /><br />After reading some reviews here, I put a wooden shelf under it to give it a more resonant platform.<br /><br />It's only been used now about 15 hours, but it's changed a lot. What seemed to be the limits of what the 10"" could support, the 12"" BIC handles without seeming stressed at all.<br /><br />The Sound of Music Blu-Ray has a scene in a church with an organ that sounded, and felt, like it was in our room. Toggling the sub off was as if the lower half of the pipes were gone. It was a stark contrast.<br /><br />I can't compare it to anything other than the 10"" Cambridge that it replaced. The main difference that I've seen between them is that at higher volumes, the Cambridge felt like a good helper of sound that wouldn't go ""boom"", while the BIC at 40% volume threatens to overwhelm, and like it's just starting to get comfortable.<br /><br />Con: The shipping box was damaged and there was a little chunk of the subwoofer's particle board case that was damaged.

"I wanted to get a monitor mount to free up some space on my desk (after I realized my monitors were taking up like 70% of my desktop space), and this mount has been wonderful. Did I always have this much desk space???<br /><br />There was a bit of assembly involved, but the directions were clear, so I did not have any trouble putting it together. I would guess the entire process took about 2 hours (from starting assembly to sitting and working again). I have a 27"" monitor and a 21"" monitor, and after some arm adjustments to get the monitors in the perfect location, I'm pleased to report they have not moved at all. I'm using both of my monitors in landscape mode, but with this mount, you have the option to turn them vertically as well, but I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />The mount also comes with a cable management system that I appreciated (wire slots/cages along the arms), as having cables hanging down from your monitors looks sloppy (and shouldn't be something you have to deal with after buying an expensive mount).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy this with mount.",5.0,i wanted to get a monitor mount to free up some space on my desk after i realized my monitors were taking up like of my desktop space and this mount has been wonderful did i always have this much desk spacebr br there was a bit of assembly involved but the directions were clear so i did not have any trouble putting it together i would guess the entire process took about hours from starting assembly to sitting and working again i have a monitor and a monitor and after some arm adjustments to get the monitors in the perfect location im pleased to report they have not moved at all im using both of my monitors in landscape mode but with this mount you have the option to turn them vertically as well but i havent tried that yetbr br the mount also comes with a cable management system that i appreciated wire slotscages along the arms as having cables hanging down from your monitors looks sloppy and shouldnt be something you have to deal with after buying an expensive mountbr br overall im very happy this with mount,1023
I was looking for a subwoofer for my entertainment system in the living room.  Came across this Pioneer subwoofer in my Amazon search. I have owned Pioneer electronics products in the past and felt they were good quality and value so I purchased this one.  Since the subwoofer and the Television are the living room and the rest of the gear is out of site in a hall closet I had to run fifty feet of cable between the closet and the living room corner where I located this unit.  Since installing it we have watched several action and horror movies and the sound is great.  It was well worth all the effort pulling cables in a hot attic to get everything hooked up.<br />This subwoofer has performed very well.

It comes with a ton of accessories, and the quality is just about as good as the Gopro costing more than 4 times as much. It is easy to operate and has a LCD screen on its back.

My final conclusion is... Gopro has set the standard, so most people use the quality of the Gopro as a measuring stick. This camera although good and incredible for the price is not as good in some aspects when compared to the Gopro. The image is more contrasty than the Gopro so in shadows you lose some detail. The colors seem a bit saturated and produce a less realistic image. This can be changed with an editor if you really need to, but not the loss of shadow detail. Build quality is good especially when you take into account the price. and the LCD screen on the back makes everything a lot easier such as settings and actually being able to see what you are filming.

"I absolutely love this surge protector. I've used this for months now and it's awesome. The side outlets that move make is SO much easier to manage using LOTS of plugs. I use this for my computer system and it's just awesome. I had trouble finding a surge protector that had enough plugs and was such a nice quality. I'm planning on getting a couple more of these for around my apartment. I really do just love this thing and I can't express that enough.<br /><br />I wish it had a longer cord, I have a large desk and my wall outlets are VERY poorly placed around my apartment. It's made it rather hard to find a place to put my desk and use the Belkin Surge Protector. The cord is really thick and it won't get damaged easily. Although the thickness made it a little hard to form but I'd rather have trouble running a cord than having it break or burn down my apartment.<br /><br />The cord management system is a little lack luster, I'm not too sure how it could be improved. It's a little small and I feel like it's too close to where the plugs, plug in. It does come in handy though, it helps reduce accidental &#34;pull outs&#34;. I think I would have rather have received a separate cord management system. It would not cost much to have it separate from the surge protector and could be screwed into a wall and that would allow better management I think.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this surge protector over others.

"My daughter enjoys listening to music in bed and on car trips. The problem with traditional headphones are that they either fall our of her ears (earbuds) or are uncomfortable if she falls asleep (over the ear). This solves those issues. Although these are advertised as more of a eye mask with music, which I imagine would be a sensory experience to promote sleep, my daughter uses them more like a headband/sweatband to wear around the house. She just cleaned her room wearing them over her forehead and it reminded me of an 80's workout video. If it's cold outside, I think they'd make a pretty interesting alternative to keep your child's ears warm as well.<br />She says they are comfortable, and sound good, although I can't verify these claims since it doesn't really fit me.

"I was really surprised at the quality of this briefcase. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it's built with a lot more eye to detail and quality than I was expecting. And it looks great.<br /><br />It has a lot of room. I'd say you could almost use this as your single carry-on piece of luggage on a quick business trip depending on the dress code. You're not going to get a suit into this, but you can wear your suit and put almost everything else you'd need in this. It's definitely within guidelines for the personal item that fits under the seat.<br /><br />Lots of pockets and places to put books, folders,  a mouse, a power-brick, and cables and almost any other accessories that you might need to go along with your laptop.<br /><br />The zippers are very high quality and you can even put a lock on the main compartment one (the other two zippers don't have the lockable fastener. There's the elastic Velcro™ strap to cinch down your laptop so it won't be moving around inside. And then there's the elastic strap on the outside that you use to strap the whole briefcase to your carry-on suitcase's handle. Has a nice padded shoulder strap along with a set of nice leather handgrips -- although they can't be connected together like some of the others.<br /><br />Lots of padding on the inside to protect the laptop itself and individual pockets for your phone, or glasses, medication, etc. You can unzip one side to expand the space (accordion-style) enough that you could use it as a suitcase for an extra pair of pants/shirts.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable for the quality you get. I like that it's made from very durable and high quality canvas-like cloth instead of leather.<br /><br />Can't really comment on how waterproof it is, but I think it would be fine if you got caught in the rain.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this at the current price of $37.<br /><br />Overall, a great laptop bag for the larger laptops (even though it will hold the smaller ones, it's perfect for the 17"" laptops.

"You know  you are an adult when you get excited to add a big bag of zip ties to your home tool box. I have an assortment of zip ties in various sizes for various tasks. If you didn't know, it is better to go a little larger than what you think you need as the length indicated is entire length and not just working length. I just so happened to have had a need for the smaller size (6"" or less) zip ties to secure some corners on a multi tier wire crate. I ratcheted them tight and trimmed off the excess. In all, I used about two dozen immediately. With a pack of 500 I should be set for awhile. Always better to have too many of these than not enough. I'll be using them for sure to secure snow netting. Not on the posts (need 10-12"" ties for that), but to hold together the overlap going from one roll or piece to the next. Since a section of netting always gets blown apart at some point during the winter, I just head out with a handful of zip ties and put it back together again. So yeh, 500 seems like a lot, but when you have them you need a bunch of them.<br /><br />The 6 inch size is also great for wire management in general, and just about any small sized securing needs.<br /><br />No complaints.

I do think the instruction booklet could have more details, the Kodak website PDF file as well. But a new user should have few problems. I did add a small metal key ring to the hook hole on the camera, and put a lanyard on it for more secure carrying. That allows it to hang securely from your neck. I don't fully trust these wrist straps they use these days. Kodak makes excellent cameras. I also have a Canon digital Rebel 6.3MP SLR, and of course that does more things, but this one is great for a nice point-and-shoot which can be used automatically, but also offers lots of modes and choices if selected.",5.0,purchased this recently from amazoncom and very happy with it so far superior picture quality the very large and bright screen is great mp produces great images that can be cropped this is my second kodak digital camera my last kodak was a dc years old which i gave to my daughter and it still takes great pictures just less megapixels features i do think the instruction booklet could have more details the kodak website pdf file as well but a new user should have few problems i did add a small metal key ring to the hook hole on the camera and put a lanyard on it for more secure carrying that allows it to hang securely from your neck i dont fully trust these wrist straps they use these days kodak makes excellent cameras i also have a canon digital rebel mp slr and of course that does more things but this one is great for a nice pointandshoot which can be used automatically but also offers lots of modes and choices if selected,936

"I had my internet provider's router and while it was okay, I don't think I would have complained about it had I NOT changed out that router with this one.

But then you sit in the 'vette, turn the key, and hear the difference, then put it in D and feel the difference.  Sleek and fast and wow, takes you for a ride!  That's the best I can explain as I'm not a techie but I have owned a sports car (Porsche 928) and the difference is a feeling more than words can express.  This router is more expensive, but with the second (or more if you get the larger group of these routers - I have two) one, the fact that I can simply plug it in in whatever room I want it (in my spare bedroom/computer room) and plugged in my desktop to the node router while the main router sits in the living room where I use my laptop.  Both laptop and computer's internet speed is so much faster now - plugged in and unplugged that it can't get much better!

"I had a 2.1 speaker set on my computer for so many years that I can't remember the brand. But after a long time of reasonably (not great) sound if finally bit the dust. So I've been attempting for months to replace it: tried Thonet and Vander (great construction, lousy sound), Creative (meh), and Cyber Acoustics (didn't even bother hooking them up). I really hate Logitech both in sound quality and construction, which leaves ... not much. Bose? Hate the tinny, muddled sound. I have a long history of simply not liking the sound profile of Klipsch, purely a matter of taste. Audioengine and Swans look so gorgeous but soooo expensive. And then I spotted Edifer, an unknown to me. Looked good, nice reviews, what the heck. Turns out they are wonderful, a little plasticky in construction but such nice sound. Clean, unaccented in the midrange, good unobtrusive bass when you find the right setting. I've been running them for about 20 hours now and the drivers are just starting to break in, and it improves by the minute. A great bargain for the price ... If this keeps up I have a new fave.<br />Update: Listening for 10 days now and I'm loving it. Burns in really well - no, it's not high end, but makes for a really nice near-field monitor, which is what a computer speaker is, isn't it?

"This very simple & versatile mouse is perfect for me. I like this low profile design both for how it fits my fingers & how it easily slips into pockets in my bag. The mouse has simple controls, left & right button, a grippy scroll wheel & a button that goes to the desktop which I love but haven't gotten used to using yet. There is another button on top that controls a light ring around the mouse that changes color but I prefer to not use the light. The top of the mouse has a slight texture like a smooth, grippy rubber coat. I'm not sure how to describe it.<br />The mouse comes with a dongle that can plug into any computer but it will also sync directly to a Bluetooth 3.0 device. There is a switch on the bottom to choose between the 2 so it could easily alternate between devices. There is a storage space in the bottom to store the dongle.<br />The mouse also has a rechargeable battery with a USB-C charge port.

"For doing videos, this is a great lens. The Bokeh is super creamy and very pleasing. I wouldn't dare say I'm a professional photographer, so I can't be a super technical judge, but in my opinion, I think it looks great also for stills. 16mm in a cropped lens isn't a rue 16mm, so I see it as more like a 24-30mm lens. it is ultra wide, so it is great for medium shots without having the camera so far away. Close-ups are great too, but of course you'd need a different lens for it, but if you want to use it, it does give a nice picture with a great depth of field. I'm glad I purchased this lens. It's really an upgrade in picture quality compared to the kit lens. Worth the money if you got it.

"I have a Stowaway Cargo box on our 2016 Forester. The camera on the car is too low to see over the box, so, after much research, I bought this one. I mounted it behing the license tag on the box, drilled a hole to run the wire from the camera through and wired the connection into the tail light in the box. This avoided a lot of hassle - pulling the rear light assembly from the car and tapping into the back up circuit, then running that wire through the body to the hitch lacation, insatlling a 2 pin plug (in case I wanted to remove the box), and running the wire along the hitch suppert, under the box and up to the camera. By running it insuide the box and over to the tail light everything was inside, out of the weather. I plugged the holes with black silicone. The monitor mount was very simple, I chose to mount it with the bottom holder with sticky foam pads provided rather than on the windshield with the suction cup/magnetic holder. It is quickly removable, along with the power cord for security. I have to turn the running lights on to power the camera but that has the added bonus of being able to use the camera while driving if wanted. I am very pleased with the tidy, easy install and performance.<br />I had previously bought a solar powered wireless camera but after several weeks the battery failed to keep a charge.

"I'm a photojournalist and really need a keyboard with illuminated characters so I can work in a dim room while editing. I've owned several illuminated keyboards. One brand was nice and bright, but fell apart after a couple of weeks. Then I used the Saitek Eclipse II Keyboard for two years, but the darn thing was never bright enough; I still had to turn on the desk lamp to hunt down the odd key or character.<br /><br />This brings us to the new Logitech Ultrathin Illuminated Keyboard. SWEET! Finally, a nicely-illuminated keyboard with bright, sharp characters. Function keys glow gold, everything else is evenly illuminated white. With the exception of the space bar, all characters are illuminated--no desk lamp necessary!<br /><br />The function keys can be programmed to launch the web, e-mail, search, calculator, messenger, music player, eject CD, etc. The palm rest is a tough, smooth, rubberized surface. The typing is smooth and ""clicky."" The design is solid, sleek and elegant.<br /><br />Even the packaging is rather attractive; this is a device that really earns five stars. UPDATE: the ""Print Screen"" button doesn't seem to work; otherwise it is fine. Note: there are no additional USB ports on this keyboard. Lastly, there is a wireless version of this keyboard that is reported to be pretty good.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: A poster noted that the Logitech software does not support Mac--ie: you can't push the ""eject"" button on the keyboard and the CD drive open up. Bummer. Works great on my PC, though.<br /><br />UPDATE 3: I've been using this as my primary keyboard for almost 18 months and it is still as good as new.

"I finally got with the times and got an iPod touch! I also workout frequently (this includes running). So I went on the hunt for a good armband that would work well with a touch screen and also not allow the player to fall out of its holding. Many of the products I researched had the same flaw: it was difficult to use the touch screen on the iPod.<br /><br />I found the tuneband from Grantwood Technology on amazon.com and all was saved! A few reviewers complained about the band scratching the back of the iPod. First, who cares if the back of your iPod is scratched?? Really. I just didn't understand that. Second, it did not scratch my iPod* (*Disclaimer: I only was using the armband for about a week before I put my gelaskin on it, so I can't attest to if the tuneband does in fact scratch the back of the iPod after 1 week). The only bad thing about this product isn't actually anything that is the manufacturer's fault. The band is only 15"" long, and my upper arm is 16"" (I prefer to think that I am just too buff for the average size armband....). Some people wear these types of bands closer to the elbow. I do not. I wear it closer to my shoulder than my elbow (it's just more comfortable for me). When I wear it closer to my elbow, the 15"" band fits. So my suggestion to you is to measure where you plan to wear it before you buy it. I could wear the 15"" band, but it was tight and pinched quite a bit (I got a bruise). I contacted the seller, asking if they had a larger band since I had read reviews from skinny girls with only 10 inch arms who said the seller supplied them with a smaller band. Grantwood Technology got back to me within a day and offered to send me a larger band free of charge! They had a 19"" and a 22"". They sent it out immediately, and I got it a short time later (maybe 3 days later but definitely not longer than 5 days later). The new band was such an improvement. No more pinching or bruising! Then Grantwood Technology emailed me to make sure I received the new band. I felt like I was a valued customer, and most companies miss the mark when it comes to good customer service.<br /><br />Seriously, I hope people can appreciate this high level of customer service, especially nowadays when it seems that we only talk to automated emails or operators. Sean was the name of the representative I talked to (who so happens to be the Co-Owner).<br /><br />Alright, here's a summary:<br />Armband: Once I got the right size, it worked perfectly. It is all velcro on one side, so this allows you to have maximum control on how tight/loose you need it to be.<br /><br />Skin: Fits well over the iPod touch and is still thin enough not to be a bother. It adds only a little weight to the player itself. You can definitely leave it on the iPod at all times (which I tend to do because I exercise 5-6 days a week, so it would be pointless for me to take it off in between uses). I have no problem charging the iPod while the skin is on.<br /><br />Screen protector: Does the job, but there are a few bubbles I just couldn't get rid of. No big deal for me.<br /><br />Overall: I think this is a great price for the three items you receive. Most iPod touch armbands cost around $30 (or more), so $19 for an armband, skin, and screen protector is a great deal I think, not to mention the great customer service. Too bad I didn't know they had the skin in purple. I would have preferred the purple over the black, but it's my own fault for not looking for another color besides black. So if you want a different color, make sure to look for it!",5.0,i finally got with the times and got an ipod touch i also workout frequently this includes running so i went on the hunt for a good armband that would work well with a touch screen and also not allow the player to fall out of its holding many of the products i researched had the same flaw it was difficult to use the touch screen on the ipodbr br i found the tuneband from grantwood technology on amazoncom and all was saved a few reviewers complained about the band scratching the back of the ipod first who cares if the back of your ipod is scratched really i just didnt understand that second it did not scratch my ipod disclaimer i only was using the armband for about a week before i put my gelaskin on it so i cant attest to if the tuneband does in fact scratch the back of the ipod after week the only bad thing about this product isnt actually anything that is the manufacturers fault the band is only long and my upper arm is i prefer to think that i am just too buff for the average size armband some people wear these types of bands closer to the elbow i do not i wear it closer to my shoulder than my elbow its just more comfortable for me when i wear it closer to my elbow the band fits so my suggestion to you is to measure where you plan to wear it before you buy it i could wear the band but it was tight and pinched quite a bit i got a bruise i contacted the seller asking if they had a larger band since i had read reviews from skinny girls with only inch arms who said the seller supplied them with a smaller band grantwood technology got back to me within a day and offered to send me a larger band free of charge they had a and a they sent it out immediately and i got it a short time later maybe days later but definitely not longer than days later the new band was such an improvement no more pinching or bruising then grantwood technology emailed me to make sure i received the new band i felt like i was a valued customer and most companies miss the mark when it comes to good customer servicebr br seriously i hope people can appreciate this high level of customer service especially nowadays when it seems that we only talk to automated emails or operators sean was the name of the representative i talked to who so happens to be the coownerbr br alright heres a summarybr armband once i got the right size it worked perfectly it is all velcro on one side so this allows you to have maximum control on how tightloose you need it to bebr br skin fits well over the ipod touch and is still thin enough not to be a bother it adds only a little weight to the player itself you can definitely leave it on the ipod at all times which i tend to do because i exercise days a week so it would be pointless for me to take it off in between uses i have no problem charging the ipod while the skin is onbr br screen protector does the job but there are a few bubbles i just couldnt get rid of no big deal for mebr br overall i think this is a great price for the three items you receive most ipod touch armbands cost around or more so for an armband skin and screen protector is a great deal i think not to mention the great customer service too bad i didnt know they had the skin in purple i would have preferred the purple over the black but its my own fault for not looking for another color besides black so if you want a different color make sure to look for it,3382

"I have gone through multiple chargers throughout my life. I tend to not follow the advice of ""Protect your phone's battery and your charger cable by not using your phone while it's charging!!"" What can I say, I'm a rebel. Because of this, my chargers don't last very long. I've had about a week of consistent use for the 4ft version of this one and I am really enjoying it. I have a few pros and one con.<br />  The positives:<br />-The cable feels incredibly sturdy in your hands. It would take a lot for it to start ripping or breaking.<br />-I tested the charging capacity with multiple reciprocals to see if it effected the charge. As expected, the charging capacity depends solely on the power it is provided with, which is great!<br />-The length is manageable without being too much. Anything 6ft or longer tends to be flaky. This 4ft is absolutely fantastic in my opinion.<br />-The lightning adapter plugs into my phone easier than the Apple branded one that came with my phone so that was a bonus! The ease of plugging in does not effect unplugging, it unplugs just like any other charger and does not fall out.<br />-The leather strap is personally useless for me since I typically never move my chargers and don't travel, but I still appreciate the accessory. The leather feels durable and the clasp is sturdy. If you are someone who travels frequently or transports your chargers, the strap will make it much more compact and easy.<br /><br />  The negative:<br />-I hate the visual design. The black with white speckles is supposed to be aesthetically pleasing, but instead it makes the charger look dirty.<br /><br />All in all, I would say this is a fantastic charger with a great price point. This charger would last much longer than others at similar price points. I will continue to be using this product consistently.",5.0,i have gone through multiple chargers throughout my life i tend to not follow the advice of protect your phones battery and your charger cable by not using your phone while its charging what can i say im a rebel because of this my chargers dont last very long ive had about a week of consistent use for the ft version of this one and i am really enjoying it i have a few pros and one conbr the positivesbr the cable feels incredibly sturdy in your hands it would take a lot for it to start ripping or breakingbr i tested the charging capacity with multiple reciprocals to see if it effected the charge as expected the charging capacity depends solely on the power it is provided with which is greatbr the length is manageable without being too much anything ft or longer tends to be flaky this ft is absolutely fantastic in my opinionbr the lightning adapter plugs into my phone easier than the apple branded one that came with my phone so that was a bonus the ease of plugging in does not effect unplugging it unplugs just like any other charger and does not fall outbr the leather strap is personally useless for me since i typically never move my chargers and dont travel but i still appreciate the accessory the leather feels durable and the clasp is sturdy if you are someone who travels frequently or transports your chargers the strap will make it much more compact and easybr br the negativebr i hate the visual design the black with white speckles is supposed to be aesthetically pleasing but instead it makes the charger look dirtybr br all in all i would say this is a fantastic charger with a great price point this charger would last much longer than others at similar price points i will continue to be using this product consistently,1748

"I recently got a projector for the house and while we have used one before we used the house as the ""Screen"" which wasn't the greatest viewing screen so I got this.  This sucker is massive but it's not that heavy which is good.  It comes with its own storage bag which I love because I don't know how I would store this otherwise.  Basically, to get this together it's a series of metal tubes and plastic connectors with two metal bases.  You can put it together yourself but with how big it is I would definitely recommend having a helper.

"We are an Android family. We are a Samsung family. We have Samsung smart phones, and watches, so when my wife's old iPad finally gave up the ghost, I asked her if it would be OK to replace it with a Galaxy tablet, which made sense to me. We are both retired so I searched for a tablet that fit our budget and at the same time would fit her needs. She mainly streams and saves recipes, so I purchased the 128 GB model since it also included the 4 GB RAM, instead of 3 GB. What a tablet. The screen is bright, the sound with the quad speakers is fantastic, and it is quick. I have yet to set it up so she can make, and receive phone calls on it, which I think she will like.<br /><br />A day after we received it there was a huge update. It is now running Android 12, the same as our phones. The only disappointment I have found so far is not being able to connect her watch to it. I hope<br />Samsung addresses this in the future.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a high-end budget tablet you might give the A8 a second thought.

"I did a lot of research (almost two years) from many sources and then created a list of 5 bins that I wanted to explore.  I visited stores and would try ones on my list, plus other 8x42's.  Even though I never tried the ones on my list &#34;side by side&#34; (no store carried all five on my list, I was lucky if they had two on my list), but when I tried the Vortex Diamondback 8x42 I knew they were on the one. I have not been disappointed. My eyes are sensitive to light and the expandable eye cups are great for keeping light from entering from the side.  The focal dial turns smoothly and are very clear.  Probably my favorite feature is the close up focus of 4.5 feet.  I do a lot of bird watching from inside my house and with a cataract that is not ready to be removed, the close up focus helps with the smallest details.

"I've had the pleasure of using some of Toshiba/OCZ's latest drives, and all are solid offerings.  This particular drive is in the value SSD segment, and honestly, you're not giving up much with these (Sandisk and PNY also make great drives at this pricepoint) drives, especially in 2.5&#34; SATA drives (the interface is more of a bottleneck than the nand/controller.<br /><br />The box these come in is small, and I didn't get any screws, adapter (these are a smidgen thinner than most 2.5&#34; hds), or keys for software.  Installation.  I'm fine with that, and installation was a breeze.  I don't tend to run any benchmarks on drives (the specs provided are rather robust), but in real world use, you'd be hard pressed to see much of a difference compared to the best SSDs (such as an Intel 750), and you're way faster than any HD.  The biggest issue I have is capacity, which is a bit limiting for games.  It's fine as a boot drive in a productivity system, as even MS Office and the Adobe Suite fit nicely in 240gb, but download a few Steam games, and well it's a bit limiting.  That being said, Toshiba has other models that come in larger capacities, and many folks don't need that much space.<br /><br />While I've yet to have any issues with Toshiba drives (nor did I ever have issues with OCZ), the included advanced warranty program is the best out there (perhaps to offset some of the concerns that folks burned by OCZ may have).",5.0,ive had the pleasure of using some of toshibaoczs latest drives and all are solid offerings this particular drive is in the value ssd segment and honestly youre not giving up much with these sandisk and pny also make great drives at this pricepoint drives especially in sata drives the interface is more of a bottleneck than the nandcontrollerbr br the box these come in is small and i didnt get any screws adapter these are a smidgen thinner than most hds or keys for software installation im fine with that and installation was a breeze i dont tend to run any benchmarks on drives the specs provided are rather robust but in real world use youd be hard pressed to see much of a difference compared to the best ssds such as an intel and youre way faster than any hd the biggest issue i have is capacity which is a bit limiting for games its fine as a boot drive in a productivity system as even ms office and the adobe suite fit nicely in gb but download a few steam games and well its a bit limiting that being said toshiba has other models that come in larger capacities and many folks dont need that much spacebr br while ive yet to have any issues with toshiba drives nor did i ever have issues with ocz the included advanced warranty program is the best out there perhaps to offset some of the concerns that folks burned by ocz may have,1342

"Ultra compact cameras like this one don't take pictures as nice as SLRs, but the best camera is the one that you use and not the one that sits at home.  And with the size and weight of this Canon you'll use it everywhere.  Another huge consideration is LCD size.  Despite its small size the SD750 has a 3-inch LCD which is bright and crisp.  The size difference over a 2.5-inch LCD is a lot more than it sounds like because it's measured diagonally.  Definitely get a big LCD no matter what camera you buy.<br /><br />As for photo quality, the SD750 is better than any other compact digital I've seen.  In full automatic mode under the right conditions (good light, stationary subjects, etc.) the photos are outstanding.  In less than perfect conditions if you want great shots you'll be well served to learn the controls and particularly the numerous scene modes.  My indoor shots in moderate light were coming out overexposed in the foreground and dark in the background, but once I started using the Indoor mode those shots looked great.  The Cloudy mode really helps bring out the colors in outdoor shots on cloudy days (as intended).  Take a little time to learn scene modes and other settings like High ISO and the different types of autofocus and you'll get much more out of this camera than if you just use full auto all the time.<br /><br />As for special features, there are more on this camera than I would ever use.  Color swap modes, red eye reduction, slide shows and all kinds of stuff I'm sure I'll never touch.  I just want to take good pictures.  If I want to edit my pictures I'll do it on my computer and not in the camera.  But if that's your thing you'll be kept busy for a long time playing around with all the stuff the SD750 has to offer.<br /><br />Finally, a great thing about the SD750 is the SPEED.  It's much faster starting up and taking shots than any other digital camera I've used.  From pressing the ON button to being ready to shoot takes less than a second.  Master the art of pre-focusing your shot by pressing the shutter button halfway and then framing your shot after it's focused and you'll virtually eliminate all shutter lag.  And oh yeah, the battery lasts a long time, though it would be nice if there was a battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left.",5.0,ultra compact cameras like this one dont take pictures as nice as slrs but the best camera is the one that you use and not the one that sits at home and with the size and weight of this canon youll use it everywhere another huge consideration is lcd size despite its small size the sd has a inch lcd which is bright and crisp the size difference over a inch lcd is a lot more than it sounds like because its measured diagonally definitely get a big lcd no matter what camera you buybr br as for photo quality the sd is better than any other compact digital ive seen in full automatic mode under the right conditions good light stationary subjects etc the photos are outstanding in less than perfect conditions if you want great shots youll be well served to learn the controls and particularly the numerous scene modes my indoor shots in moderate light were coming out overexposed in the foreground and dark in the background but once i started using the indoor mode those shots looked great the cloudy mode really helps bring out the colors in outdoor shots on cloudy days as intended take a little time to learn scene modes and other settings like high iso and the different types of autofocus and youll get much more out of this camera than if you just use full auto all the timebr br as for special features there are more on this camera than i would ever use color swap modes red eye reduction slide shows and all kinds of stuff im sure ill never touch i just want to take good pictures if i want to edit my pictures ill do it on my computer and not in the camera but if thats your thing youll be kept busy for a long time playing around with all the stuff the sd has to offerbr br finally a great thing about the sd is the speed its much faster starting up and taking shots than any other digital camera ive used from pressing the on button to being ready to shoot takes less than a second master the art of prefocusing your shot by pressing the shutter button halfway and then framing your shot after its focused and youll virtually eliminate all shutter lag and oh yeah the battery lasts a long time though it would be nice if there was a battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left,2200

"I think this panel light works better than a ring light. It provides a wash of light that to me looks even more flattering than a ring light. The only disadvantage this round panel light has to a ring light is you can't mount a phone or camera in the middle of it without blocking some of the light, but it works great with the camera mounted just below (with the included phone holder) or to the side.<br /><br />The stand is preassembled and extends tall enough for most uses. The included power adapter has about eight feet of cord. The remote control is simple to operate --  basically just three functions, brightness, warmth, and on and off. The complete kit isn't very heavy so it's pretty easy to move around to different locations.",5.0,i think this panel light works better than a ring light it provides a wash of light that to me looks even more flattering than a ring light the only disadvantage this round panel light has to a ring light is you cant mount a phone or camera in the middle of it without blocking some of the light but it works great with the camera mounted just below with the included phone holder or to the sidebr br the stand is preassembled and extends tall enough for most uses the included power adapter has about eight feet of cord the remote control is simple to operate basically just three functions brightness warmth and on and off the complete kit isnt very heavy so its pretty easy to move around to different locations,714

"I am using these racks for ribbon for my sewing studio. They are very well made and heavy duty, they hold about 80 (20 each row) of 1 inch wide grosgrain ribbon. I have both 50 yards and 100 yards on them and they fit fine. Really pleased with this purchase and am going to order another one.<br /><br />Cons:<br />My two complains (very minor), I wish it would have come with screws and anchors for anchoring to the wall. I sort of guessed at what size I needed and luckily it was right.<br />My other complaint is that opening up the item although it was fairly easy to put together the little bag of screws is terrifying upon first look. The instructions are similar to something from IKEA and I'm still not entirely sure if the sides were supposed to completely fit inside the top and bottom pieces or half and half.

"Fantastic for hearing impairment. I'm deaf in one ear due to the hair cells in my cochlea not functioning. Last night I got these and for the first time I was able to hear things in surround sound and I also experienced directional hearing for the first time. Basically, if I take the ear piece away from my good side I can absolutely hear noise from the piece on my bad side. It's not as loud as the good side (because the noise has to travel across my skull to get to the functioning cochlea on my left side) but it's loud enough to be coherent and to provide that sense of surround sound and for the brain to determine direction. It feels like I am in the middle of music with speakers all around me rather than it just being on my left side. I'd say there's a slight left bias of where  I think the music is since that ear hears things more loudly but the effect of direction is remarkable.<br /><br />If anyone buys this with single sided deafness, please try this video my spouse found for me. It's the clearest example I've found of directional hearing:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IXm6SuUigI (it's a virtual barber shop that is specifically to demo directional hearing). Make sure to have your volume up higher than normal to get the full effect.<br /><br />I also showed this to a buddy who is just hard of hearing and he immediately bought his own pair since his hearing problem is in his middle ear and this sidesteps that part entirely. So he was hearing music perfectly for the first time in a long time. Music that wasn't just being amplified through his hearing aid but was actually getting to his cochlea via another path on both sides.<br /><br />My normal hearing friends like the idea of this for exercise but expressed that they do work much better for them if they have ear plugs in.",5.0,fantastic for hearing impairment im deaf in one ear due to the hair cells in my cochlea not functioning last night i got these and for the first time i was able to hear things in surround sound and i also experienced directional hearing for the first time basically if i take the ear piece away from my good side i can absolutely hear noise from the piece on my bad side its not as loud as the good side because the noise has to travel across my skull to get to the functioning cochlea on my left side but its loud enough to be coherent and to provide that sense of surround sound and for the brain to determine direction it feels like i am in the middle of music with speakers all around me rather than it just being on my left side id say theres a slight left bias of where i think the music is since that ear hears things more loudly but the effect of direction is remarkablebr br if anyone buys this with single sided deafness please try this video my spouse found for me its the clearest example ive found of directional hearingbr its a virtual barber shop that is specifically to demo directional hearing make sure to have your volume up higher than normal to get the full effectbr br i also showed this to a buddy who is just hard of hearing and he immediately bought his own pair since his hearing problem is in his middle ear and this sidesteps that part entirely so he was hearing music perfectly for the first time in a long time music that wasnt just being amplified through his hearing aid but was actually getting to his cochlea via another path on both sidesbr br my normal hearing friends like the idea of this for exercise but expressed that they do work much better for them if they have ear plugs in,1718

"I have a TomTom Start and I have disliked the EasyPort mount from the day I got it. I had been telling my wife for months that I was going to get a “proper” mount for my TomTom and that day finally came when I accidentally broke the EasyPort mount. After a little research I decided on this particular mount, and so far I have been very pleased with it.<br /><br />I wanted a more “normal” windshield mount - a suction cup with a lever instead of a twist ring, and that led me to this particular mount. The design is simple - press the suction cup against the windshield and flip the lever to make the cup stick to the window. In operation this is an easy-to-use mount and it seems to hold the navigator in place without too much trouble. As expected it does not hold well when it the windshield is cold, which is an issue with every suction-based mount I have ever used - including the EasyPort.<br /><br />The ring in which the TomTom attaches to the mount holds the TomTom in place well enough but I have observed that it does not hold the navigator tightly. That is, the TomTom has a tendency to turn a little in the ring. So far this has not been an issue and the TomTom has not fallen out of the ring so this really does not bother me.<br /><br />The mount is adjustable and provides for a couple of places where the position can be tweaked for maximum visibility. There should be no issue with getting the position of the GPS just right so it can be seen but not in the way.<br /><br />So far I am pleased with this mount and am happy to recommend it. It’s a lot easier to use than the EasyPort mount that comes with the TomTom and it’s adjustable enough to make visibility a non-issue, even while in motion. If you have a TomTom and you don’t like the EasyPort mount, this mounting system is a big improvement.",5.0,i have a tomtom start and i have disliked the easyport mount from the day i got it i had been telling my wife for months that i was going to get a proper mount for my tomtom and that day finally came when i accidentally broke the easyport mount after a little research i decided on this particular mount and so far i have been very pleased with itbr br i wanted a more normal windshield mount a suction cup with a lever instead of a twist ring and that led me to this particular mount the design is simple press the suction cup against the windshield and flip the lever to make the cup stick to the window in operation this is an easytouse mount and it seems to hold the navigator in place without too much trouble as expected it does not hold well when it the windshield is cold which is an issue with every suctionbased mount i have ever used including the easyportbr br the ring in which the tomtom attaches to the mount holds the tomtom in place well enough but i have observed that it does not hold the navigator tightly that is the tomtom has a tendency to turn a little in the ring so far this has not been an issue and the tomtom has not fallen out of the ring so this really does not bother mebr br the mount is adjustable and provides for a couple of places where the position can be tweaked for maximum visibility there should be no issue with getting the position of the gps just right so it can be seen but not in the waybr br so far i am pleased with this mount and am happy to recommend it its a lot easier to use than the easyport mount that comes with the tomtom and its adjustable enough to make visibility a nonissue even while in motion if you have a tomtom and you dont like the easyport mount this mounting system is a big improvement,1756

"Polk MagniFi Mini AX Sound Bar (2022 Model), Dolby Atmos and DTS:X Certified, Polk's Patented VoiceAdjust & SDA Technologies, Ultra-Compact Design, Easy Setup<br /><br />First the design. The soundbar is a great size for use under a PC monitor. It looks great and is actually smaller than some soundbars target at PC use. The subwoofer enclosure though is kind of huge. The design is a bit dated compared to the compact sleek design of the soundbar. The remote is chunky and feels old as well although is well laid out with all of the functions on the remote.<br /><br />The sound is fantastic. It's only about 20 inches or so from where I sit so the volume is relatively low. At low volume the surround still sounds amazing. I play FPS games and the directional audio is really clear.

It is very fast, and was a very easy installation once I got a working unit. So far it has worked flawlessly.<br />I also have to comment on the wonderful service from Amazon with this unit. It surprised me that it took quite a while to get, and then with the defective unit it took even longer for me to get it into service. In the meantime the price was reduced twice.

"This is for a USB 3.0 hub but I'm actually using it in a USB 2.0 slot on the computer because there is another 3.0 hub using the only 3.0 port on the computer. (My computer has 1 USB 3.0 and 3 USB 2.0 ports, go figure.)<br /><br />That's fine as I have about twice as many items that are 2.0 than are 3.0 (Today anyway).  The cord is perhaps a foot and a half (i didn't measure it) but it's too short for my needs so I purchased on Amazon ""Cable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type A to B Cable in Blue 6 Feet"". Note that one end is a 3.0 type A and the other is a 3.0 type B.<br /><br />I had a cheap 10 port 2.0 hub before with a tiny power supply and upgraded to this figuring future items will be USB 3.0 (and I'll have more 3.0 ports). There are 9 ports as stated and one 'Power only' port for 2.1A device recharging. I would rather have 10 ports available but I know some folks will have a use for the heavy duty recharging port.<br /><br />My only recharging is my Logitech headphone and it's recharging from one of 9 regular USB port.<br /><br />So, right now I have the stock 3.0 cable going into a female 2.0 jumper that goes to a 2.0 port on my computer.  This cable mess will be replaced by the above single cable.<br /><br />It has blue lights but at least they don't link.  The hub is now full with 9 USB 2.0 items and all seems to be working better than before.  I tried plugging it into my existing 3.0 hub but somethings didn't work properly (Headphones). The power supply is a big honk'n brick! 12 Volts and '5 Amps'!<br /><br />This was sold by AnkerDirect Via Amazon.<br /><br />I don't understand this statement: ""For maximum performance devices connected to the 9 ports should not exceed 8 Amps (total)! Unless it's getting some current from the host computer I don't understand where the other 3 Amps are coming from unless the power supply is actually rated higher than stated. (I wouldn't count on it.  Most of my 2.0 stuff is off most of the time and are connected just for convenience for when they're needed. Of course the rating was '12 Volts' (not the usual 5.0 volts) at 5 Amps and that would be 60 Watts total, perhaps that's where the extra current is coming from as a result of the voltage step down? It could just be magic. They did say 8 AMPS Max! Wow!<br /><br />Anyway,I arrived a day early, worked exactly as stated, not even hot but does have a short (for me anyway) connecting cable. The connecting cable from the hub to your computer HAS TO BE USB 3.0 and a 2.0 cable is not going to mate at the hub (mine didn't).<br /><br />Built in surge protection.<br /><br />Happy and would recommend this and hope the review helps with your decision as it is a bit pricy.

"I have a strong interest in photography and I always keep an eye open for lights and equipment that will help me take more creative or impactful pictures. I selected this light with the intent of using it for creative photography and so far I am pleased with it. I have other LED lights that have similar functions, but this one is different in a few ways that set it apart.<br /><br />This is a wand light as opposed to a square LED bank. As such, the light distribution is a bit different. It can directly cover a longer (wider) area which is handy when putting together a mock-up with miniatures. It has a couple of mounting options too, utilizing either a miniature tripod (included) or magnetically attaching to a metal surface. I do wish a clamp was included such that it could attach to the tripod horizontally, but such clamps are available if they're needed.<br /><br />This light is VERY bright and can easily light a small room when at full brightness. It can be dimmed to cast a soft light too which is good. It's not exactly the most ideal light source but it will work for general lighting in a pinch.<br /><br />The temperature range goes from 2500k (very warm and orange-y) to 9900k (blistering cold white) and everywhere in between. Getting the color just right is relatively easy though it does take a little patience and experimentation to get it right. Do keep in mind that because this is an LED-based light, the temperature band setting is quite narrow and presents a different light profile, one that the camera can see but the human eye cannot. In addition to ""natural lighting"" modes it can be set for specific colors too such as purple, red, blue and so on.<br /><br />Charging is done via a USB-C port, and the charging cable is included. I have not tried using this as a power source to charge my phone though the documentation doesn't say much about that. A full charge on this light lasts a while, though I have not drained it all the way down to find out how long it will last. Obviously the runtime is variable based on mode and brightness, and what is interesting about this light in particular is that it displays the estimated runtime on the screen based on current settings - this is a nice feature that I have not seen on a lot of these lights.<br /><br />There are some creative modes for use with video or for special effects in a live setting, though the usefulness of these modes is dependent on the user. I personally will never use them. However, in the right hands these might be very useful for a project.

"I have never posted a review before, but I felt like this bag deserved one.<br /><br />I spent a good deal of time scouring Amazon and searching for the right messenger bag for my 11-inch MacBook Air. I chose this one because it looked sturdy and relatively thin, and I haven't been disappointed. I've used it now for about 2 weeks, and I haven't noticed any wear or tear. I fill it pretty full and relatively heavy (like the weight of one textbook plus odds and ends), and nothing is fraying or breaking. It fits a lot of things for how thin it is, and I like that it has an extra pocket for the laptop charger and external hard drive. The laptop compartment seems to be pretty well padded, and the material has some sort of velvet-like feel- I don't worry about harming my expensive laptop, and I haven't found any problems yet. I love the nice, wide strap that the bag has, which comes in very handy with all the walking I have to do on campus; it doesn't become uncomfortable, and I can switch it around and wear it in front, to the side, or behind me. And I have yet to grow tired of the coloring- I really do enjoy the little pops of light blue, and the grey isn't as harsh as a black. It also doesn't look dirty; granted, it's only been a couple weeks, but I think the durability of the material is just fantastic.<br /><br />For those who are searching everywhere (like I was), there are a few little cons to the bag, but they haven't been too detrimental for my purposes. First, there isn't a space to put a water bottle, but I just hook mine onto the strap and carry it around all day. If your water bottle doesn't have a hook/handle, that may be a problem unless you can fit it into the bag. And forget coffee, unless you hold that separately. Also, there isn't a lot of room for extra things. There are a lot of handy pockets to stuff things, but they add up and make the bag look very bulky. I also can probably fit more things than the average user, since my Mac is so incredibly thin, so I would keep that in mind if you plan on lugging around multiple textbooks at a time. I've noticed that I'll need to buy a lunchbox/bag because I can't fit in food (especially leftovers) unless they're little like a granola bar. For my uses, having the computer was my main priority, and this bag is almost perfect. Another small drawback was that though the front pocket is handy to stick things in (including my cell, iPod, et cetera), things get lost down at the bottom, especially if the inside of the bag is really full. Probably my biggest grievance is that though the bag is made of a heavy-duty material, it is soft and doesn't stand up on it's own. I have to prop it up against a table leg, which there's often not enough room for me to do in class, so it lays on its back most of the time; however, I would prefer the softness of the bag to one with hard edges.<br /><br />I hope your search just became a little easier- good luck!",5.0,i have never posted a review before but i felt like this bag deserved onebr br i spent a good deal of time scouring amazon and searching for the right messenger bag for my inch macbook air i chose this one because it looked sturdy and relatively thin and i havent been disappointed ive used it now for about weeks and i havent noticed any wear or tear i fill it pretty full and relatively heavy like the weight of one textbook plus odds and ends and nothing is fraying or breaking it fits a lot of things for how thin it is and i like that it has an extra pocket for the laptop charger and external hard drive the laptop compartment seems to be pretty well padded and the material has some sort of velvetlike feel i dont worry about harming my expensive laptop and i havent found any problems yet i love the nice wide strap that the bag has which comes in very handy with all the walking i have to do on campus it doesnt become uncomfortable and i can switch it around and wear it in front to the side or behind me and i have yet to grow tired of the coloring i really do enjoy the little pops of light blue and the grey isnt as harsh as a black it also doesnt look dirty granted its only been a couple weeks but i think the durability of the material is just fantasticbr br for those who are searching everywhere like i was there are a few little cons to the bag but they havent been too detrimental for my purposes first there isnt a space to put a water bottle but i just hook mine onto the strap and carry it around all day if your water bottle doesnt have a hookhandle that may be a problem unless you can fit it into the bag and forget coffee unless you hold that separately also there isnt a lot of room for extra things there are a lot of handy pockets to stuff things but they add up and make the bag look very bulky i also can probably fit more things than the average user since my mac is so incredibly thin so i would keep that in mind if you plan on lugging around multiple textbooks at a time ive noticed that ill need to buy a lunchboxbag because i cant fit in food especially leftovers unless theyre little like a granola bar for my uses having the computer was my main priority and this bag is almost perfect another small drawback was that though the front pocket is handy to stick things in including my cell ipod et cetera things get lost down at the bottom especially if the inside of the bag is really full probably my biggest grievance is that though the bag is made of a heavyduty material it is soft and doesnt stand up on its own i have to prop it up against a table leg which theres often not enough room for me to do in class so it lays on its back most of the time however i would prefer the softness of the bag to one with hard edgesbr br i hope your search just became a little easier good luck,2825

"If you remember the old game unit switches that allowed you to use multiple devices on one television set, this is like that, only for two computers sharing one monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals. The simple switch box connects to your monitor (&#34;console&#34;) via the kind of cord with plugs on both ends you currently use to connect your monitor to your computer. (You will need an extra cord like this for the the purpose--not included. If you don't have a spare lying around, you should order one with the unit.) You will need the cords you are currently using for each of the two computers to connect them to the box. There are four USB sockets in the &#34;console&#34; section of the box. You plug your keyboard, mouse, and anything else you want to share between the two computers into those. (By the way, KVM stands for Keyboard, Video,Mouse.) The unit is powered, and offers multiple plug styles for international use. There is a place to plug in speakers and a mike for each computer. This switch has made it possible for me to streamline my office space considerably. Previously, I had two monitors, two keyboards, and two mice. It was very awkward. I kept my old computer because it has Adobe CS4, which is fine for my needs and saves me the $50 a month the Creative Cloud would cost. I have not used it much, though. Firing up the old machine was just too much trouble.

"I've had this TV for about a month and it is everything I had hoped for and more. The picture is outstanding. I can't get over the detail and the vivid color. The controls, including the remote, are very intuitive and easy to use. The pedestal, which allows turning the unit in different directions, works well and is a nice feature to have. The only design feature I would criticize is the unit controls at the bottom right of the screen are very difficult to see. In ordinary room light, I would need reading glasses and a flashlight to have any hope of using them. Since all of these controls are normally performed using the remote, this is not a problem of any consequence.<br /><br />The internet apps seem to work well enough, but I don't have much need for them since most everything I would be interested in has a charge and is probably already available from my satellite TV subscription. I had hoped maybe to save money by using the internet to replace some of my satellite TV subscription costs, but it doesn't look like that is going to work.<br /><br />This replaced a 37 inch 720p TV. Prior to making the purchase, I was concerned that I was wasting money on a new set and that I wouldn't notice much difference. Believe me, the difference is night and day. I have glasses with a very slight long range prescriptionand rarely wore them when watching the old set, however, I rarely will watch the new one without them. The detail just adds so much to the viewing experience.<br /><br />I chose to buy an lcd rather than an led, because I had read many reviews that indicated that, due to the thinness of the led housings, the speakers were not usually large enough to give satisfactory sound. I really didn't want to buy an additional speaker system and this set provides sound that meets my needs. Also, I had compared displays of various led's to this lcd and the picture difference was virtually indistinguishable, certainly not worth the price difference.",5.0,ive had this tv for about a month and it is everything i had hoped for and more the picture is outstanding i cant get over the detail and the vivid color the controls including the remote are very intuitive and easy to use the pedestal which allows turning the unit in different directions works well and is a nice feature to have the only design feature i would criticize is the unit controls at the bottom right of the screen are very difficult to see in ordinary room light i would need reading glasses and a flashlight to have any hope of using them since all of these controls are normally performed using the remote this is not a problem of any consequencebr br the internet apps seem to work well enough but i dont have much need for them since most everything i would be interested in has a charge and is probably already available from my satellite tv subscription i had hoped maybe to save money by using the internet to replace some of my satellite tv subscription costs but it doesnt look like that is going to workbr br this replaced a inch p tv prior to making the purchase i was concerned that i was wasting money on a new set and that i wouldnt notice much difference believe me the difference is night and day i have glasses with a very slight long range prescriptionand rarely wore them when watching the old set however i rarely will watch the new one without them the detail just adds so much to the viewing experiencebr br i chose to buy an lcd rather than an led because i had read many reviews that indicated that due to the thinness of the led housings the speakers were not usually large enough to give satisfactory sound i really didnt want to buy an additional speaker system and this set provides sound that meets my needs also i had compared displays of various leds to this lcd and the picture difference was virtually indistinguishable certainly not worth the price difference,1907

"If you are serious about doing aerial imagery, you need this set. DJI does an EXCEPTIONAL job of equipping their aircraft with the best cameras, with the best features you can get in a pro-consumer aircraft. I honestly believe that the Mavic Mini 3 Pro cannot be improved upon. In the 'under 250 gram' class, this is the best you can get.<br /><br />However, not even DJI can equip their aircraft cameras to get the highest quality, most striking, most enhanced images that true experts want. So, DJI has collaborated with a few quality lens filter makers to give us what we want.<br /><br />Skyreat is one of those companies. I have their lens filter sets for all of my DJI aircraft. I get stunning images, every time. It takes some training to understand which environments and which desired results lead to which filter to use.

The light weight and super sturdy aircraft grade aluminum frames are made to exacting specs. Every lens is crystal clear, no flubs, no distortion, with exact perfection over the entire image.<br /><br />The carrying case is well made, protecting all the filters and fits easily into the aftermarket carrying case that I use for the aircraft.

"Okay, I had to write a review on this. Anyone who has used a cheap screen cover knows what a challenge they can be! An example:  I purchased a new cover for my cell phone about a month ago after dropping and cracking the old one (hey, it saved my phone screen so I'm not unhappy), and the cheap new one I bought was a real pain to install.  It was sticky, so when I tried to stick it to my phone it got fingerprints all under the backside that will not come off.  It will not lie flat.  It has bubbles that cannot be removed.  Its thin as saran wrap.  Basically, I hate it.<br /><br />But this fire hd protector from OMOTON is amazing!  It came with easy instructions and went on like a breeze, no fingerprints or bubbles.  It is thick, which will offer great protection for my kindle screen.  It aligns perfectly without covering the camera lens.

"In this age of Zoom and remote work, I needed something that prevented me from going idle on my computer software.  My company prevents installation of any third party software, so I knew I had to go the hardware route to make this work.  I tried other DIY options (e.g., putting the mouse on a wrist watch's second hand) but nothing worked really well.  This one is bulky, but there's no mistake - it will move your mouse incrementally every second or so to ensure you never go idle.  I've been using this for a week now and it has been functioning fine.  I highly recommend this product - just make sure you keep it out of view on your Zoom calls :)",5.0,in this age of zoom and remote work i needed something that prevented me from going idle on my computer software my company prevents installation of any third party software so i knew i had to go the hardware route to make this work i tried other diy options eg putting the mouse on a wrist watchs second hand but nothing worked really well this one is bulky but theres no mistake it will move your mouse incrementally every second or so to ensure you never go idle ive been using this for a week now and it has been functioning fine i highly recommend this product just make sure you keep it out of view on your zoom calls,623

"I was skeptical at first but read the other reviews and decided to try it. It works great for us! Plugged it in and started using it right away. We had to use channel 3 for best reception. One unit is in the basement and the other unit is on a cabinet at the top of the stairs in the kitchen. For best results don't move close to the unit to talk. Just stand upright next to the unit and speak normally. The back-lit buttons are great, easy to see in the basement with just a lamp on for lighting. I was worried my 87 year old Dad might have trouble using it. He has Parkinson's Disease. He had no trouble at all! No more screaming down the stairs to a person with hearing loss and no hearing aids. The call button works great also. Can buzz it from upstairs and can hear if it goes off downstairs to make sure Dad has turned on his unit.",5.0,i was skeptical at first but read the other reviews and decided to try it it works great for us plugged it in and started using it right away we had to use channel for best reception one unit is in the basement and the other unit is on a cabinet at the top of the stairs in the kitchen for best results dont move close to the unit to talk just stand upright next to the unit and speak normally the backlit buttons are great easy to see in the basement with just a lamp on for lighting i was worried my year old dad might have trouble using it he has parkinsons disease he had no trouble at all no more screaming down the stairs to a person with hearing loss and no hearing aids the call button works great also can buzz it from upstairs and can hear if it goes off downstairs to make sure dad has turned on his unit,815

"I was looking for a good, basic clock radio to replace the one I had that had begun to behave as if it was possessed by a demon.  This one... well I wasn't sure but the price was good, and it absolutely fit the space requirement so I requested it, and was pleasantly surprised.  Many clock radios are miserably hard to set and program, but this one is surprisingly easy.  The instructions are clear, and it doesn't take any extraordinary effort to get the time, day and year set, or to add station presets to the mix.  The dimmer is excellent.  At Level 1 it's just bright enough for me to read without disturbing my sleep.  The sound is good, the bluetooth function works well, and is easy to activate.  It charges my phone overnight just the way a direct connection to a power strip would.

"The sound on this little gadget is great, very pleasantly surprised with it. My phone (note 8) had a little trouble connecting at first but turns out my watch (gear s3) was being ornery. Once that was resolved it connects fine.<br /><br />Just one thing I'd change. The blinky lights. They're cool for about a minute. Then the realization sets in that not only can I not have it just glow a color, it keeps blinking in this annoying pattern and there's no way to turn it off. I bought this speaker to sit on the counter in my master bath. I'd intended to keep it plugged up in there so I didn't have to mess with turning it on or off. Not blinking, it may have made a cool nightlight... But blinking it's like a disco nightlight. It's rather bright.

"I have been using this mouse for more than a year now and I recently purchased another one for my second laptop. The rechargable battery (included) lasts for a long time for me, several weeks I would say. When it is finally dead, you can simply pull and attach the cable and still continue to use the mouse while charging it. As the previous reviewer said, the cable is not long, but I find it more than enough with my laptop. Perhaps it's not so with a desktop computer.<br />On the down side, the mouse resolution is not very high. If you are working on pictures, creating high resolution drawings, etc. (i.e. trying to click on a particular pixel on the screen among 1 million others) this mouse may not work for you.

"I bought two of these and registered them both on my and my wife's LastPass accounts.  Now we are protected against the loss of either yubikey with the second Yubikey serving as a backup.<br /><br />There are minor issues with using the Yubikey.  For example, it works with setting up muti-factor access on a Google account, but only with the Chrome browser, not Firefox.  I hear Firefox is making changes to its browser to enable this functionality.<br /><br />Using multi-factor access on LastPass is great and simple.  I can see how I am more secure from someone who might get my LastPass login credentials.  But individual passwords can be hacked from sites (Yahoo, for example, has had user accounts hacked) and the login data would permit access by simply bypassing LastPass.  As more sites add Yubikey-type factors to login options, then that opening in security should be eliminated or reduced.  I don't understand why online banking hasn't universally adopted this type of verification system.<br /><br />I decided to go with Yubikey as I do a fair amount of international travel and getting access codes by phone is not a good option when out of the country.",5.0,i bought two of these and registered them both on my and my wifes lastpass accounts now we are protected against the loss of either yubikey with the second yubikey serving as a backupbr br there are minor issues with using the yubikey for example it works with setting up mutifactor access on a google account but only with the chrome browser not firefox i hear firefox is making changes to its browser to enable this functionalitybr br using multifactor access on lastpass is great and simple i can see how i am more secure from someone who might get my lastpass login credentials but individual passwords can be hacked from sites yahoo for example has had user accounts hacked and the login data would permit access by simply bypassing lastpass as more sites add yubikeytype factors to login options then that opening in security should be eliminated or reduced i dont understand why online banking hasnt universally adopted this type of verification systembr br i decided to go with yubikey as i do a fair amount of international travel and getting access codes by phone is not a good option when out of the country,1118

"I needed to replace my aging WD NAS, which was struggling to keep up with my needs.  After quite a bit of research and product comparisons, I decided to go with the market leader, and bought a NAS that seemed likely to be able to support my needs for several years, and offered some options for expanding the ways I use a NAS.<br /><br />For context, I mainly use my NAS as ""network-attached storage"": I back up files, and I share files for use on our multiple home computers.  I don't use it for remote access (security concern: I'd rather use cloud storage services for that), and I don't use it as a repository for a media server, or anything else like that.<br /><br />I decided to use WD ""Red"" drives for this unit: based on specs and user and professional reviews, they seemed most likely to run reliably for as long as I needed.  My previous experience with WD black, blue, and red drives has been consistently positive, whereas other vendors have let me down.<br /><br />Installation and setup was very easy: I had the unit up and running within a few minutes.  Copying files over from my old NAS took some time, but the performance of this Synology unit exceeded my expectations.  I was also pleased with how much faster my backup jobs were.  I was especially pleased when apps that use network files began running much faster: so clearly both read and write performance were much improved in comparion with the old system.<br /><br />I also set up a USB backup. It took a little bit of reading in the Synology KB to learn how to do it right, but after that it was a breeze.  I plugged in a USB hard drive in the back port (the front port can be configured for use with the USB Copy button), opened up the Hyper Backup app, and ran the initial backup to copy the entire NAS contents to the USB drive. Then I scheduled it to run incremental jobs every day, so now my paranoid backup demon is happy.  (I save backup drives in a secure location to provide ""disaster recovery"";  overkill perhaps, but it buys peace of mind.)<br /><br />One criticism: the unit came with only 2GB memory, which seems cheesy.  And what makes is super-cheesy is the way they price their branded ""compatible memory"" at ridiculous multiples of the market price.  I was able to buy a 4GB Samsung memory card for under $15, and it worked just fine.  You can do a web search and see that others have upgraded using larger memory cards.<br /><br />The Synology KB website is very good: it's well written and comprehensive.  There's also an active user community, so there is a ton of information easily available.  Overall I'm very happy with my Synology purchase, and would buy their NAS products again without hesitation.",5.0,i needed to replace my aging wd nas which was struggling to keep up with my needs after quite a bit of research and product comparisons i decided to go with the market leader and bought a nas that seemed likely to be able to support my needs for several years and offered some options for expanding the ways i use a nasbr br for context i mainly use my nas as networkattached storage i back up files and i share files for use on our multiple home computers i dont use it for remote access security concern id rather use cloud storage services for that and i dont use it as a repository for a media server or anything else like thatbr br i decided to use wd red drives for this unit based on specs and user and professional reviews they seemed most likely to run reliably for as long as i needed my previous experience with wd black blue and red drives has been consistently positive whereas other vendors have let me downbr br installation and setup was very easy i had the unit up and running within a few minutes copying files over from my old nas took some time but the performance of this synology unit exceeded my expectations i was also pleased with how much faster my backup jobs were i was especially pleased when apps that use network files began running much faster so clearly both read and write performance were much improved in comparion with the old systembr br i also set up a usb backup it took a little bit of reading in the synology kb to learn how to do it right but after that it was a breeze i plugged in a usb hard drive in the back port the front port can be configured for use with the usb copy button opened up the hyper backup app and ran the initial backup to copy the entire nas contents to the usb drive then i scheduled it to run incremental jobs every day so now my paranoid backup demon is happy i save backup drives in a secure location to provide disaster recovery overkill perhaps but it buys peace of mindbr br one criticism the unit came with only gb memory which seems cheesy and what makes is supercheesy is the way they price their branded compatible memory at ridiculous multiples of the market price i was able to buy a gb samsung memory card for under and it worked just fine you can do a web search and see that others have upgraded using larger memory cardsbr br the synology kb website is very good its well written and comprehensive theres also an active user community so there is a ton of information easily available overall im very happy with my synology purchase and would buy their nas products again without hesitation,2572

"I have two of the Sony Bluray players - one new and one old. Both of the remotes worked on both of the players. Somehow we lost or misplaced one of the remotes and because of that we had to keep sharing the one between the two. I bought this replacement remote to put an end to that.<br /><br />The new remote looks and functions exactly like the ones that came with the players. About the only difference is the lack of the Sony brand logo and the fonts used on the buttons are not quite the same. But other than that - they are identical.

"These headphones were a recent gift for my birthday and I must say they are very impressive. At first I didn't realize that the jack had two options so I didn't get to use these the first day. My friend who gave them to me explained that you just twisted off the larger jack to get the smaller jack which then fit into my CD player and computer.<br /><br />The band that goes across your head also can be a bit uncomfortable but I fixed that problem with a wool headband I wear during the winter. I put it between the metal and my scalp. That was more comfortable and the metal seems to soften a bit with wear. You can also buy a wool cover to make it more comfortable, which my friend is also sending me. The extra effort it takes to make these comfortable is worth it. See photos.<br /><br />As far as the sound goes, these reveal a pristine clarity in everything you listen to. I especially love how John Lennon's Woman sounds and also I listened to Ulrich Schnauss' Goodbye and Evening Ocean's The Kiss. Wow. Everything sounds new again. I hear additional things in songs I never heard before. I'd say listening to music on these headphones is as close to an out of body experience you will ever have. You will feel like you are floating in an ethereal domain of sounds. Vocals all become more interesting as the sound is softened and each note is crystal clear. The sound does seem to hypnotize you a bit. I feel that these headphones reveal the complexity of music in all its beauty. What you get is an ecstatic experience.<br /><br />You will fall in love with AKG all over again when you get these headphones. I had the AKG K240 headphones for years and really loved them. In comparison these are sonic bliss. Even my Sennheiser cordless headphones don't sound this good. I have a feeling I'm going to be listening to a lot more music than normal. Once you put these headphones on it is hard to stop listening. I spent probably four or more hours the first day I put these on. I just had to listen to all my favorites one after the other to see how they would sound. I was not disappointed. As I told my friend the fact that I'm thrilled about these headphones is a major understatement. They are worth the investment for the high level of pleasure they produce.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. It's 2021 and my first AKG K553s fell apart in my hands the other day after six years. So it was time for a new pair. They don't last forever especially if you use them all the time.

"I got this to listen to music while in the shower. It has one large suction cup to hold it. Unfortunately the tile in my shower is not perfectly smooth, so the suction cup looses it's grip, but I found it works perfectly stuck to the bottom of the shower shelf. Sound quality is good, but seems a little tinny with the water running. Volume is not a problem, it can get plenty loud for the shower. From the speaker you can adjust volume, skip back and forth, and pause playback. You can also take a call, but I haven't tried that feature (and who really wants to have a conversation from the shower?)  Battery life seems pretty good. I only have two gripes about it. When I first turn it on the volume always seems to be set at maximum, so I always have to turn it down before starting playback.

"As I had purchased a multi camera Eufy system during Amazon prime, I was curious as to how the Dragon would compare.  I had purchased a Dragon tablet for my sister earlier in the year and found it to be as good as the name brand ones which cost far more.  This review in large part compares the Dragon to the Eufy system.<br />The first thing you notice is that the Dragon system comes in plain cardboard boxes with only the companies name printed on the outside where the Eufy comes in boxes like you would see on store shelves in shiny white with photos of the product and information aimed at encouraging purchasing.  I assume that the fancy packaging costs more and that the customer is paying for it in the final price.  While perhaps needed in brick and mortar retail, it is not necessary when purchasing from Amazon. The sample photos and descriptions are shown on the listing.  Everything was neatly boxed and separated.  Each camera with its complete accessories were individually boxed, enabling you to just take the box to where it will be located, minimizing the chance of loosing a part.<br />The instruction manual is fairly easy, if you are familiar with things like tv and computer system setup, this is similar with the added steps of getting the area scanned by the motion detecting camera set up properly.  Dragon is better than the Eufy system which had minimal instruction and seemed to rely on intuitive understanding from looking at diagrams.  The only critique here is that the instruction manual is about 3 X 5 inches, so you may need to get reading glasses! Both have online resources if needed. The Dragon instruction booklet can be downloaded on line, making it far easier to review.<br />The Eufy system was fairly well complete.  While you could sign up for a monthly fee to have cloud storage, there was storage provided in the unit itself.  In most home applications you don't want or need constant video coverage, but only recording when motion is detected.  Each ""event"" (motion detected activation) is listed separately, so it is easy to review it immediately, save to another storage device if needed, but typically delete the event after checking it out.  The Dragon is set up on the same principles.  With the added drive the Dragon has I believe more base unit storage capability.<br />You will need to purchase a couple extra items to get the most functionality out of the system. Dragon is quite explicit in the description above as to what things are not included, so you can purchase them at the same time as you do the system to have everything there at the same time.  The component you will need to purchase is the SATA internal hard drive.  The instructions provide clear detail as to installation as adding an internal hard drive would be something I would be nervous to do absent  extremely clear guidance.<br />While I suppose the white tower block shaped ""home"" unit used by Eufy might be a bit more showy, the Dragon one is infinitely more practical.  It is shaped like most wifi or routers.  It is about 2 inches tall and 10 x 10 inches.  That is the perfect shape and size to fit on a shelf.  If your home is like mine, your wifi, router, components and other devices are located where the largest most frequently used television is located.  I have built in shelves under the cabinet build to hold the television but whether you have a shelf system or have yours in a free standing cabinet this base unit is far more likely to fit easily with the other necessary components.  The advantage of having it next to your primary family tv is that you can wire it to the tv,thus using your tv as a large screen monitor of the events recorded.  Both systems have the capability to view events remotely on your phone.<br />The cameras are very similar to the Eufy ones in functionality.  You can set them to recognize ""human faces"" so that the neighbors dog doesn't constantly trigger an alarm when it comes for a visit.  With both you can set the area covered which is critical as I learned the first week when every car going down my street was captured as a motion event.  I know some of my neighbors have systems that record constantly and include a street view.  I wanted this solely for security and want only to record when someone gets close to my home.  For one thing I would not have any interest in reviewing a 24 hour view of my street!<br />Both systems have apps you can download to your cell phone.  This has become a feature I now find critical that I had not considered important prior to installation.  I don't know how often I am out walking the dog when someone comes to the door.  The other thing that seems to happen frequently is that I take a shower midday and that will be when the UPS decides to deliver.  While you no longer have to sign for package delivery, in my neighborhood particularly around the holidays, we have issues with porch pirates nabbing packages.  Even if I don't need to go to the door, a camera alerting me means once the driver is gone, I can sneak to the door and immediately retrieve the package.<br />Both Eufy and Dragon's ""live"" hours are M-F,  9a.m. to 5p.m. eastern time. Both would be better off expanding those hours as most people install these on the weekends or after work and that is when ""live"" support is not available.<br />The weather has interfered with my ability to mount the cameras. I have however been able to check the system out.  (The Eufy system is likewise pointed out windows as I purchased it in the late fall and was waiting for warmer, dryer weather to permanently affix outside the window where it was intended to go. The funny part is that both systems cameras can rest easily on the windowsill and will record movement outside the glass, just as if they were already mounted!  With six cameras, my home will be covered very well.  I plan to place one in the garage as upon more than one occasion my garage door has opened after it was closed and but for a neighbor noticing and calling, all of the things stored in my garage would have easily walked away.  This way if it happens again and if someone enters the garage, it will trigger a motion activated camera and alert me.<br /> Once completed I will add to this review should I encounter issues or benefits unique to this system.  All of them are a bit of a pain to mount, you need to get on a ladder, drill holes, etc. Having installed a video door bell into brick/mortar, I can absolutely recommend that this is the surface you want to avoid if at all possible. if you can have a second person to ""fetch"" and ""check"" the picture for you it will be easier and quicker to finish.  The cameras have wires so you can power them to the area where the camera is placed if you are replacing an old system and already have electricity to the locations where you will mount them.  The size of your home and distance from your home base/wifi will determine how well you pick up signals obviously.  If you have an unusually large home or if your base/wifi is located where the signal is difficult to pick up (like your basement) or where there are multiple exterior walls, I found that purchasing a signal amplifier fixed the issue.  The room over my garage has to go through the exterior wall and since it is an L shape off the main part of the house, pick up the wifi signal through the front exterior wall of the house.  I had to install a signal booster for the television in that room.  I anticipate that at least one if not two of the spots selected for mounting will require amplification.  Every other spot is easily within range and there are not numerous exterior walls impeding signal strength.<br />The Dragon system doesn't have the alarm or the ""speak to"" function of the Eufy, which quite honestly is fine.  I have not used that function even one time in the six months with the video doorbell because by the time I get to my cell phone or a monitor the person has already left!  So while it sounds great, I suspect you won't really miss it.<br />The cameras need to be hooked up to an electrical source unlike the Eufy which uses rechargeable batteries. The Eufy advertises the long life of the battery charge and so far it has been about 6 months and the one mounted hasn't needed additional charging.  Taking the camera down to charge, if it is mounted very high will be a pain in the rear.  I plan to have an electrician add power for where these will be mounted high up and use the Eufy on the lower level and at the basement level.  With one in the garage and one inside the screened in porch that will mean I have 4 cameras and the video doorbell camera which should more than cover the remainder of the house.  There will be a one time charge in getting the wiring completed, but the peace of mind you get in return is well worth the relatively small amount of money it will cost.  Check with your home owner's policy.  In mine, having a security system decreased my policy charges.  That alone may make up for the added costs associated with the Dragon system.<br />This 3 camera system is about half of what I paid for the Eufy system.  In that regard the Dragon system is far better.  Both have good cameras, similar operational setup and the same critical functions.  it is most likely like comparing apples to oranges when you look at a wired vs. battery powered camera system, if you want something that you can install without hiring an electician, particularly if you think you might like some of the interactive features than Eufy may be best for you.  If however you want to put it up, particularly in a higher location or you are likely to remain in the same residence and not want to take the sytem with you, the Dragon system may suit better.  It may even be an added feature when you go to sale your home. Both have excellent night vision (if you have not seen a YouTube video of the night vision function from these cameras prepare to be shocked at just how good they are.)  Both have the ability to discern human faces. Both work as advertised and provide similar levels of customer service.  If I had to choose today and the power source was not an issue.....I would purchase .......either one, I just can't choose, so will use them both!",5.0,as i had purchased a multi camera eufy system during amazon prime i was curious as to how the dragon would compare i had purchased a dragon tablet for my sister earlier in the year and found it to be as good as the name brand ones which cost far more this review in large part compares the dragon to the eufy systembr the first thing you notice is that the dragon system comes in plain cardboard boxes with only the companies name printed on the outside where the eufy comes in boxes like you would see on store shelves in shiny white with photos of the product and information aimed at encouraging purchasing i assume that the fancy packaging costs more and that the customer is paying for it in the final price while perhaps needed in brick and mortar retail it is not necessary when purchasing from amazon the sample photos and descriptions are shown on the listing everything was neatly boxed and separated each camera with its complete accessories were individually boxed enabling you to just take the box to where it will be located minimizing the chance of loosing a partbr the instruction manual is fairly easy if you are familiar with things like tv and computer system setup this is similar with the added steps of getting the

"After a recent trip where I carry my camera gear, upon reaching my destination I found that I had literally hurt my shoulders and back. I carry 2 cameras, a canon camcorder, separate flash unit, 5 different lenses including a 70 - 200 lens, and various attachments. Immediately I searched for a camera bag on wheels. This bag from Amazon seemed to fit all of my requirements for a roller bag. When I received it, it exceeded my expectations. It was light and had room for all of my gear. What a difference this bag has made. It is constructed very well with stitching that is very good. There were enough separators to compartmentalize all of my gear to my preferences. By the way, the bag can be used as a backpack style because it contains the straps for that purpose. But the probability is fantastic.

"My friend is really happy with this unit; I got it for him because is does quite a few delivery services like Door Dash, Uber, etc and needs the navigation on the road AND his phone to effectively do his job, plus he likes to use YouTube for music. With this awesome stereo, he can do all that and more! The video quality is wonderful and the sound is great too. It is not an easy install, but I keep the five stars because it is truly a valuable unit for all that it does. Get some help from a mechanic or car freak friend and you should have no problem; the additional parts you have to purchase for it are not expensive and take nothing away from all that you are being GIVEN!

"I got this case for my Acer C720, in case I didn't want to lug my backpack. It works well in protecting and carrying the Chromebook. There's some stretchy straps inside to hold the device but its by no means an effective way to just open the case and you also open the laptop up. The straps are just there to keep the device from moving around too much.<br /><br />The other reviews are correct in stating that there's a lot of wiggle room, especially for the C720, but for me, that's just extra space for other things like flash drives, iPod etc. If you're looking for something snug, a sleeve might be better.

"YES.

Just a consequence of using two mics close together.<br /><br />I am very happy with this splitter. It was cheap and did not affect the quality of sound, at least not that I could tell.

"This system is replacing a 10yr old Night Owl 560p (yuck!) system which was probably the entry level standard at the time.  So I'll be making some comparative observations along the way to explain why I am so happy and impressed with this system.<br />First off, it arrived quickly. The packaging was nice and well laid out. So far the instructions have seemed adequate, however, I am not using some of the advanced features like the App or networking.<br />  Since I had base unit, I decided to just do a simple swap out of 2 of the cams. The power and BNC cables exactly matched my old cables which I had needed to upgraded to 100' lengths.  So.. I decided to just use the OLD cable and power connector.<br />  Went back to my base unit... No video. Hmm. Apparently the cams do not downgrade output for the old system?<br />So... Now I had to get out the base unit and install it.. Not what I was planning on. That took some time to setup.<br /> First I dumped the old TUBE TV and installed a moth-balled Seiki 20"" 720p TV that someone had given me. My old night owl did NOT have HDMI. So that was a nice upgrade. (The old system also claimed to be color, but never showed color through the yellow RCA video cable that came with it, which had made it a struggle to discern which buttons were active on the screen for the whole 10 yrs. Ugh).<br />  Zosi System booted up and identified the TV and set resolution to LESS than 720p?? Hmm. At this point I had no video feeds hooked up. But later I tried to set the system to 720p and... It did display, but the picture ran off the edges of the screen and I couldn't see some buttons. So I'm thinking this cheap Seiki TV is not a true 720 resolution.. Back to the default settings which work just fine.<br />  I hooked up the cameras to the system. I wish the connectors on the base unit were placed about 1/4"" further apart. This was very difficult.<br />I was still using the Night Owl power supply for the cams. Still NO video.<br />I swapped out the for the  Zosi power supply and... VIDEO! The night owl fed 1.2 amps to the cams and the Zosi feeds 2 amps. Apparently, the better cams require slightly more power.<br />  OMG! The clarity AND field of view were OUTSTANDING!<br />It was night so I got concerned that I was stuck with another B/W set of cameras. I did some research and discovered that night vision is always B/W. Good enough.<br />  My old cams had about an 60 degree view. I had mounted 2 cams side by side under the corner of the roof to view the ENTIRE back yard. These new cams have a much wider width almost double my old cams. So I kind of have a redundant cam up there now But I'm not complaining.<br />  So then I went out to fine tune the adjustment. There are little notches where the cam locks in to a specific angle. On 2 of the cams I needed it to be in-between this setting, which is NOT possible. So... I cut a tiny wedge of wood and aimed the cam Low, then used the wedge to adjust the back of the mount down, pulling the cam Up! Viola.. Fine tuned! I went ahead and caulked around the base and the wedge to try and discourage critters from nesting under the base.<br />  Speaking of which, the base of the cams is nice and includes a foam seal. I like that design. The angle adjustment screw seems cheesy and wanted to strip the head. That was one of my few disappointments.<br />  Back inside again, I decided to check the recordings. The interface of the night owl system is almost unusable, as well as their included remote which only registers within 2 ft of the base unit.<br />  I had to clear some extra space for the Zosi mouse, but well WORTH IT!<br />The interface on this Zosi unit is very well thought out and intuitive. I click on a cam feed and it goes full screen. I double click and I'm back on multi-cam.<br />  When you go to REPLAY, there are so many helpful features, I'm sure I'll miss some. I do wish they had pop-up explanations when you hover over a button, there are so many!<br />  - There is a scroll bar on the bottom where you can click at any interval in the current recording and immediately go there. It is pretty responsive as well.<br />- There are Previous timeframe/ Next time frame buttons.<br />-  You also have an array of buttons. FF, pause, etc.<br />I may have to try and find an adjustment to reduce responsiveness of the mouse. But I can usually click the button I want within a couple of tries.<br /> - You can also ZOOM in on a part of the picture. For instance, I heard the cat Yelp while I was setting up the system. I was able to easily navigate to the last 5 minutes and saw nothing but the cat in the dark.<br />I was able to replay, Zoom in on the cat and see that a snake had apparently taken residence under a tarp in the yard. (The cat seems fine.. The snake, not so much).<br />-<br /> I am not using motion detection at this time. On the old Night owl system, MD failed to record much of anything. So I've been in full record mode with automatic overwrite for a few years now, since my last cat was kidnapped without any video clues.<br />On the (hopefully) rare occasion that you have to go to your system to review something.. You want the recording to be there!<br />  I am not sure yet how many days of recording I can get with 4 cams. If I can get 30 days that would be acceptable,I'd prefer 60 days though. This has 2TB and I've seen a 4TB drive also. Time will tell.<br />-<br />So today, I was able to see the full COLOR recordings and I'm still impressed. I did adjust the TV to VIVID mode to make the colors pop a bit more.<br />  I'm using 3 of the cams and an old SD wide angle cam for the front door. I was so intrigued with the HD cams that I got back on Amazon to order an HD wide angle cam... Disappointment!<br />Apparently there are not any 120 degree cams available for ANALOG systems with 8MP resolution. I almost ordered a couple of different ones, only to do more research and find they are ""Ethernet only (POE)"" cams which are not compatible with this system 😣.<br />  I did finally settle on a Ares 5MP wide angle cam which is still a bit questionable and pricey. Once again, wait and see, when it gets here.<br />  I also would have liked audio on the door cam, But Nope! I'll include a link for the Ares cam here. I don't know anything about that brand, but I'd never heard of Zosi either.<br />I can't see why they don't include 1 wide angle cam with these starter systems or at least an optional package. The default cams are way to narrow to put outside your door and see ANYTHING.<br />Plus apparently, Zosi doesn't even supply that type of cam at all!! Which is a SHAME. Zosi cams seem to be of great quality.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07HCSW8VP/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />-<br />-<br />I'll try to make updates as the system evolves.<br />At least we can feel safe while we're all home self-quarantining! 😂😂😂👍<br />Update: 4-8-20<br />The Ares cam arrived quickly and meshed with the system flawlessly. Didn't have to adjust anything. Impressed with it, although wouldn't mount it near weather. It's tucked nicely under the porch above the door.

"This keyboard has a great, solid keyboard feel. I have average-sized male hands and while it feels a little tight when typing a long document, it is still comfortable. I love all the keyboard shortcuts included! There are a few keys that must do triple duty (shift, normal or control key combos) but I found a way around many of them: settings>genera>keyboard>text replacement let me eliminate most of the times I need to use apostrophes, for example, and I also came up with a question mark workaround that way. The hyphen and quotation marks still need to use the control key, but didn't take me long to learn to do that more or less automatically.  This is literally the only thing I can criticize about the keyboard. I've had a lot of iPad keyboards over the years and this one is the best one I've used (besides the Magic Keyboard on a Pro). I also love the fact that this can be used in either landscape or portrait mode (!) The magnets when using the keyboard are adequately secure, and when in ""carry"" mode it is very secure, as there is more contact with the back cover. The screen angles one can get are very useful and practical. It doesn't move around on the table. As another reviewer wrote, charge it before setting it up (takes 1-2 hours).  The weight is only 5 ounces more than a standard protective cover, and the bulk is the same. The tiny bit of extra weight is worth it IMHO, and is less than nearly all others and much less (and more convenient) than carrying a separate folding keyboard. The weight including the iPad Mini is only 1 pound 3 ounces (the iPad weighs a little over 10 oz by itself).

"After playing around with the settings on my sound bar and TV, I was pleased with the crisp and clear sound transfer that this product provides. It does exactly what it says it does. The blue light is bright, sure, but nothing to complain about at all. A small piece of electrical tape will do the trick if it bothers you. I hear absolutely no humming or other sounds coming from the converter, regardless of the volume. It is a good and affordable buy. Just make sure that you do your research to ensure that it is compatible with your TV/device. Most seem to work fine.

"Beautiful true blacks and insanely lifelike vivid colors make the picture pop almost like it's 3D/ real life!  Very impressive features jam packed into this! Sound is amazing- you won't need a soundbar at all. Super thin screen, the thickness of a folder. Screen has a nice metal edge which helps protect it. Setup was quick and easy. Very slim lightweight remote with nice shortcut buttons to all of your favorite streaming services. Apps load quickly and run smoothly in this tv.<br /><br />Feet are easy to install, no tools or screws which is amazing. They can be attached to make your tv flat on the surface or raised so you can put a soundbar down. You can also put the feet closer together and further apart. Lots of options which is nice!<br /><br />Some of the features I love on this are:<br />*The auto light sensor- it adjusts the screen brightness based on the lighting of the room. (this feature can be turned off of course)<br />*Acoustic auto calibration- you sit wherever (like on your couch) and it sends these loud sound blasts that sound like alien gun blasters. The blasts reach the mic in your remote where you are sitting and then the tv records the information and auto calibrates the sound so it reaches you better based on your room and where you're sitting.<br />*The speakers use vibration to turn the whole display into a loudspeaker- sending sound everywhere. Small subwoofers in the back to give it an extra bump of bass. You absolutely notice this technology working- the sound is amazing and PLENTY loud. You can always add surround sound if you have to have a deep boom of bass like in the movie theater though.<br />*XR Motion processing- means blur-free scenes. You can really notice this on things like watching sports from football to surfing.<br />*Upscaling is great. HDR is fantastic too- I really notice the differences in skin tones, they look a lot more natural on this tv. The XR processor really puts noticeable light into the highlights of the picture which really helps the image pop.<br /><br />The bravia core seems more like a advertising gimmick, wasn't impressed with that at all.<br />That aside- this tv does definitely tout a lot of tech packed into one nice looking slim package! It has a TON of settings and customizations you can play with and set it up exactly like you want it! I've never seen so many different settings in a tv! No worries, if you don't want to customize, you certainly can just choose one of the standard programmed modes and the tv still produces a gorgeous picture!<br /><br />CONS:<br />*The only ones I have noticed that might be a deal breaker are there is no functioning VRR and it only has two hdmi 2.1 ports which might mean that you won't want this if you're a gamer.<br />*Has a matte anti reflective coating which really doesn't do an amazing job at keeping reflections out of the tv like the coating they put on the 90J- that one does a better job. It doesn't make it unwatchable, it's just that sometimes you might notice a reflection in the tv in settings with windows nearby or a light fixture that shines near it.<br /><br />Comparing this to the 90J I notice some other things:<br />The 80J doesn't have the heatsink in the back that the 90J does. This might become noticeable for gamers and is a letdown.  The speakers are a little less powerful in this tv than the 90J, they sound good but don't have as much power. The 80J doesn't have the backlit Sony remote that the 80J has which is crazy and a replacement remote in case you're wondering costs a whopping $80!!<br /><br />At $1300 less than the 90J, the decision for me is clear! I definitely say go with this 80J because the small improvements aren't worth paying the $1300 more. BUT if price isn't an issue- go for the 90J. I can tell you for sure, you'll be happy with either that you choose, they're both fantastic devices that are well built and jam packed with the latest tech and features.",5.0,beautiful true blacks and insanely lifelike vivid colors make the picture pop almost like its d real life very impressive features jam packed into this sound is amazing you wont need a soundbar at all super thin screen the thickness of a folder screen has a nice metal edge which helps protect it setup was quick and easy very slim lightweight remote with nice shortcut buttons to all of your favorite streaming services apps load quickly and run smoothly in this tvbr br feet are easy to install no tools or screws which is amazing they can be attached to make your tv flat on the surface or raised so you can put a soundbar down you can also put the feet closer together and further apart lots of options which is nicebr br some of the features i love on this arebr the auto light sensor it adjusts the screen brightness based on the lighting of the room this feature can be turned off of coursebr acoustic auto calibration you sit wherever like on your couch and it sends these loud sound blasts that sound like alien gun blasters the blasts reach the mic in your remote where you are sitting and then the tv records the information and auto calibrates the sound so it reaches you better based on your room and where youre sittingbr the speakers use vibration to turn the whole display into a loudspeaker sending sound everywhere small subwoofers in the back to give it an extra bump of bass you absolutely notice this technology working the sound is amazing and plenty loud you can always add surround sound if you have to have a deep boom of bass like in the movie theater thoughbr xr motion processing means blurfree scenes you can really notice this on things like watching sports from football to surfingbr upscaling is great hdr is fantastic too i really notice the differences in skin tones they look a lot more natural on this tv the xr processor really puts noticeable light into the highlights of the picture which really helps the image popbr br the bravia core seems more like a advertising gimmick wasnt impressed with that at allbr that aside this tv does definitely tout a lot of tech packed into one nice looking slim package it has a ton of settings and customizations you can play with and set it up exactly like you want it ive never seen so many different settings in a tv no worries if you dont want to customize you certainly can just choose one of the standard programmed modes and the tv still produces a gorgeous picturebr br consbr the only ones i have noticed that might be a deal breaker are there is no functioning vrr and it only has two hdmi ports which might mean that you wont want this if youre a gamerbr has a matte anti reflective coating which really doesnt do an amazing job at keeping reflections out of the tv like the coating they put on the j that one does a better job it doesnt make it unwatchable its just that sometimes you might notice a reflection in the tv in settings with windows nearby or a light fixture that shines near itbr br comparing this to the j i notice some other thingsbr the j doesnt have the heatsink in the back that the j does this might become noticeable for gamers and is a letdown the speakers are a little less powerful in this tv than the j they sound good but dont have as much power the j doesnt have the backlit sony remote that the j has which is crazy and a replacement remote in case youre wondering costs a whopping br br at less than the j the decision for me is clear i definitely say go with this j because the small improvements arent worth paying the more but if price isnt an issue go for the j i can tell you for sure youll be happy with either that you choose theyre both fantastic devices that are well built and jam packed with the latest tech and features,3748

"With working at home more and competing with some family noise in the background, I decided to get a pair of dedicated headphones to use with computer for video conferences. I decided to get a more reputable brand since it was important to make sure the sound quality was good (both the sound received and sent). I also wanted to use something a little more concealed so this was a good pick.<br /><br />It connected to my computer with no issues.

"As of this review these earbuds cost $24.49, and I think that's reasonable for what you get.  These connected via Bluetooth instantly to my PC but it took several attempts to get them to connect to my android phone but eventually they did.  These answer calls just fine and do all the phone stuff but I don't really use them for that.  I like to listen to various podcasts and music.  The sound is pretty good and once I get them situated in my ears I forget they're there.  The case is really easy to carry in my purse and is easy to keep the earbuds charged.  I don't know how long the battery life is because once I finish using them I put them back in their case.  But I have worn them for over 2 hours and they held a charge that long.",5.0,as of this review these earbuds cost and i think thats reasonable for what you get these connected via bluetooth instantly to my pc but it took several attempts to get them to connect to my android phone but eventually they did these answer calls just fine and do all the phone stuff but i dont really use them for that i like to listen to various podcasts and music the sound is pretty good and once i get them situated in my ears i forget theyre there the case is really easy to carry in my purse and is easy to keep the earbuds charged i dont know how long the battery life is because once i finish using them i put them back in their case but i have worn them for over hours and they held a charge that long,711

"I used this watch to replace a Fitbit that failed. And the Fitbit replaced a Samsung Gear that failed twice. All failuers were just after the warranty ran out. So to say that these trackers are cheaply made is an understatement. So far the Garmin has been solid. All of the functions work well, even the GPS tracking. The weak spot with the device has been the lack of clear DETAILED instructions how to navigate the functions to get to perform as designed. With 5 buttons on the device propper pushing in a specific order is critical. The documentation is vague and only gives general instructions on each buttons function. That leaves searching U tube for videos created by users that do poor job explaining the processes. So my biggest complaint is the steep learning curve of manipulation to achieve a desired goal. So the watch works well, if you have the time and patience to navigate the buttons and menus to make it work.",5.0,i used this watch to replace a fitbit that failed and the fitbit replaced a samsung gear that failed twice all failuers were just after the warranty ran out so to say that these trackers are cheaply made is an understatement so far the garmin has been solid all of the functions work well even the gps tracking the weak spot with the device has been the lack of clear detailed instructions how to navigate the functions to get to perform as designed with buttons on the device propper pushing in a specific order is critical the documentation is vague and only gives general instructions on each buttons function that leaves searching u tube for videos created by users that do poor job explaining the processes so my biggest complaint is the steep learning curve of manipulation to achieve a desired goal so the watch works well if you have the time and patience to navigate the buttons and menus to make it work,913

"This was my first MMCX work (converting a pair of grado SR80x's into some custom planar magnetics with drivers from the goldplanar GL400's) I ruined my first one accidentally getting solder on the threads (my fault) but the second one went together nice and easily. Just make sure you're using very Fine gauge solder (0.022 was what I used) and appropriate gauge wire (28 AWG is perfect for these) along with flux paste. For security, I got a pack of fine heat shrink too. A set of helping hands (cheap ones will do, but cheap ones with a magnifying glass are better)<br /><br />Here's how to actually solder these things<br /><br />Firstly, tin the wires (critical) by dipping the ends in flux and then adding some solder to them. This will make the connection way faster and cleaner.<br /><br />Then tin the mmcx itself. flux the very ends and add a TINY amount of solder to the very end of the outer rim and the center pin (that's the signal pin, where your positive wire goes) Then carefully solder the ground wire first, and the signal wire second. Make sure that you can get the nut over the wire, secure the connector where you want it (if you're doing MMCX grados, you need to use your soldering iron or a drill bit to make a new hole next to the original one since these are smaller than that) and then slip some heat shrink around the ground wire to separate it from the signal, some shrink around the signal wire, and then a piece over both.<br /><br />I would honestly order two of these for one job if it's your first time, or get a 5 pack. These are quite small, so make sure you have all the right stuff.

"This is probably the best keyboard I have ever owned- and I've owned at least 20 different ones.<br /><br />Let me run down the list of what makes this keyboard so remarkable.<br /><br />1.  Apple-like attention to detail.  From the packaging itself, which is efficient, minimal, printed on plain recycled cardboard, and easy to open.  It is easy to open and a delight.<br /><br />2. This keyboard is beautiful- much better than the very nice keyboards that come with the desktop Macs.<br /><br />3. The keys are the perfect size: bigger than the thin Apple Chiclet keys which I've never gotten used to as a fast touch typist (80+ wpm) and smaller than full-travel bulky cheap keyboards that come with generic desktops.<br /><br />4. The keyboard itself is thin, light and beautiful.  It is thinner than other wireless keyboards because it has no AAA or AA batteries inside.<br /><br />5. The solar cells work great, save the environment, and allow for the elegant design.<br /><br />6. The keyboard does require a USB port for the little wireless thing.  One drawback is you &#34;lose&#34; the two USB ports on the Apple wired keyboard.<br /><br />7. The easy to download App is amazing- it auto installs easily and gives you a visual on your computer screen to show how your batteries are and how many lumens your keyboard is getting.<br /><br />8. The actual keyboard is EXACTLY laid out like the Mac keyboard- all the function keys work perfectly as designed.<br /><br />9. Online support is fantastic- simple, clear, and answers all questions.<br /><br />10. There is a dedicated solar button on the keyboard which you can press to see if you have a decent charge, and if you are getting enough sun.<br /><br />11. There is absolutely no delay in typing.<br /><br />12.  While Apple gives you a choice: either a wireless keyboard that is truncated and missing the number pad, or a wired full keyboard, this great keyboard offers both at the same time: a full keyboard AND wireless!<br /><br />This is just a wonderful, high quality product.  Don't think of it as a standard Logitech product- this one is one of the best devices I've seen them produce.<br /><br />ONE COMPLAINT:  On the website here, on battery life, it says &#34;Infinity.&#34;  No, sorry, not even close.  The battery dies after about 2, maybe 3 years of use.  I'm on my third one already.  Even if it gets enough light to keep it fully charged, the battery will die, and if you try to change it, when you open up the keyboard, the battery looks standard, but it is marked &#34;DO NOT REPLACE.&#34;",5.0,this is probably the best keyboard i have ever owned and ive owned at least different onesbr br let me run down the list of what makes this keyboard so remarkablebr br applelike attention to detail from the packaging itself which is efficient minimal printed on plain recycled cardboard and easy to open it is easy to open and a delightbr br this keyboard is beautiful much better than the very nice keyboards that come with the desktop macsbr br the keys are the perfect size bigger than the thin apple chiclet keys which ive never gotten used to as a fast touch typist wpm and smaller than fulltravel bulky cheap keyboards that come with generic desktopsbr br the keyboard itself is thin light and beautiful it is thinner than other wireless keyboards because it has no aaa or aa batteries insidebr br the solar cells work great save the environment and allow for the elegant designbr br the keyboard does require a usb port for the little wireless thing one drawback is you lose the two usb ports on the apple wired keyboardbr br the easy to download app is amazing it auto installs easily and gives you a visual on your computer screen to show how your batteries are and how many lumens your keyboard is gettingbr br the actual keyboard is exactly laid out like the mac keyboard all the function keys work perfectly as designedbr br online support is fantastic simple clear and answers all questionsbr br there is a dedicated solar button on the keyboard which you can press to see if you have a decent charge and if you are getting enough sunbr br there is absolutely no delay in typingbr br while apple gives you a choice either a wireless keyboard that is truncated and missing the number pad or a wired full keyboard this great keyboard offers both at the same time a full keyboard and wirelessbr br this is just a wonderful high quality product dont think of it as a standard logitech product this one is one of the best devices ive seen them producebr br one complaint on the website here on battery life it says infinity no sorry not even close the battery dies after about maybe years of use im on my third one already even if it gets enough light to keep it fully charged the battery will die and if you try to change it when you open up the keyboard the battery looks standard but it is marked do not replace,2322

"I wish I had these many years ago!  They make my keyboard so much easier to read.  My Dell keyboard has small white letter in the upper left corner that were never easy to read.  They have also faded over the years and were never visible in the dark.  Now I can see in the dark and the letter, numbers and words are a great size.  I got the large print, black background with yellow print.  They have made my life a whole lot easier!  I was thinking about getting a new keyboard, but that won't be necessary now.  These stickers are better than any keyboard.  Very easy to install It took about 30 minutes.  Be careful when taking them out of the plastic bag and don't let the sticky stuff on the bag flap touch the stickers.  It messed up a few of mine, but they weren't that important so it's okay. A few of the stickers don't match my keyboard, but they are ones I don't use much such as Scroll lock and pgup.  I just trimmed ""Insert"" off the sticker and put it on my key so it didn't cover the 'print screen"" on it.  My key is insert/print screen combo.  Anyway, they are great.  I highly recommend them.<br /><br />October 1, 2020 - It's been over  year and several of the stickers have come off and some of the others are smeared.  I'm going to order another set though because most of them are still fine.  I like the big letters.  One thing that has helped, which has nothing to do with these letters, is that I put a rubber drawer stopper on my backspace key so I can feel it without having to look for it.  It's been awesome since my keyboard is on a piece that slides out from under my desk.

"I ordered this backpack as a gift so I can't comment on how it will wear, but I can comment on how nicely it looks and how well it is made. The confusing part is that label says for up to 15"" laptops, but my 17"" Dell laptop fits just right in and it seems to feel nicely while on the back. The padding adds a lot of comfort too. Very NICE looking, has lots of features that add on value. For example, the pocket for IPod or phone or whatever you prefer to listen to has a convenient slide-through pocket which allows you to nicely organize your earphone cables.

"When I first pulled these out of the nice box that they come in, I thought they looks / felt a little “flimsy”.  But then I put them on, and found that they are quite comfortable and sound fantastic!  These are not nearly as “clunky” as some other headphones that I have, and I think that’s a very good thing.  They fit well, and I don’t have any problem wearing them for long periods.  The app is easy to download and set-up.  The noise-cancelling works great, and music is very crisp and clear.  I have some in-ear noise-cancelling headphones, and though they work well also, I’m more of an “over-the-ear” sort of person for comfort and even better sound.  These headphones certainly fit that bill.<br /><br />It comes with a very short 9” USB-C charging cable.  It also comes with a headphone cable and in-flight adapter.  HD voice for phone and up to 30-hours of battery time.<br /><br />One of the most unique features of this headset is how you control the volume and so on.  You do so my tapping / swiping the outside of the right headphone.  Please your hand over the right headphone, and it lowers the volume, so you can talk to someone.  Remove your hand, and it goes back to normal.

"There are two kinds of wireless mice: bluetooth and radio frequency (RF). They have advantages and disadvantages, of course.<br /><br />The most common is the RF mouse. These tend to be cheaper and batteries last longer. However, you need to attach a receiver to a USB port on your computer. Luckily, most RF mice today come with a tiny receiver that only protrudes slightly from the USB port. Problem is, the protrusion, small as it is, can catch on an edge and break off. Also, if you have a bag for your laptop that is a tight fit, even the small protrusion can get in the way. And, of course, if you want to use the mouse with a tablet, you won't have a USB port and can't use an RF mouse. That was the case for me.<br /><br />A bluetooth mouse usually costs more and batteries don't last as long. However, as long as your device has bluetooth, you don't need to add any receiver. Almost all laptops (PC and MAC), tablets and smartphones have bluetooth, so a bluetooth mouse is the most universally accepted. One bluetooth mouse can even be paired with multiple devices.<br /><br />That's where the beauty of this particular mouse comes in. The price is low, comparable to an RF mouse, and batteries last for months because of an auto shut off feature. It is solidly built, the scroll wheel is quiet, and the buttons click with a positive feel.<br /><br />I have replaced the RF mouse on both my PC and MAC laptops with this bluetooth, and used it with my Dell tablet (which, of course, has no USB port). The mouse is accurate, pairs easily, and is instantly recognized when I turn it on. It has a convenient on-off switch on the bottom, but also automatically turns off after it is not used for a few minutes. It reactivates instantly when you move the mouse again.<br /><br />It is from a top brand company (HP) and I highly recommend it.",5.0,there are two kinds of wireless mice bluetooth and radio frequency rf they have advantages and disadvantages of coursebr br the most common is the rf mouse these tend to be cheaper and batteries last longer however you need to attach a receiver to a usb port on your computer luckily most rf mice today come with a tiny receiver that only protrudes slightly from the usb port problem is the protrusion small as it is can catch on an edge and break off also if you have a bag for your laptop that is a tight fit even the small protrusion can get in the way and of course if you want to use the mouse with a tablet you wont have a usb port and cant use an rf mouse that was the case for mebr br a bluetooth mouse usually costs more and batteries dont last as long however as long as your device has bluetooth you dont need to add any receiver almost all laptops pc and mac tablets and smartphones have bluetooth so a bluetooth mouse is the most universally accepted one bluetooth mouse can even be paired with multiple devicesbr br thats where the beauty of this particular mouse comes in the price is low comparable to an rf mouse and batteries last for months because of an auto shut off feature it is solidly built the scroll wheel is quiet and the buttons click with a positive feelbr br i have replaced the rf mouse on both my pc and mac laptops with this bluetooth and used it with my dell tablet which of course has no usb port the mouse is accurate pairs easily and is instantly recognized when i turn it on it has a convenient onoff switch on the bottom but also automatically turns off after it is not used for a few minutes it reactivates instantly when you move the mouse againbr br it is from a top brand company hp and i highly recommend it,1752

"I have had a number of PC TV tuners through the years and this one is the best, so far.  Because it is a USB tuner, it allows ""picture in a picture"" on your PC monitor.

The DVR software that is bundled with the tuner works really well.  It is particularly helpful to use it with the recommended Titan TV Website.

"The fit and finish of this bag are top notch. I've been camping and backpacking for decades and I have to say the quality of this bag and the workmanship are among the best I've seen. The nylon material is heavy duty and durable. The bag and shoulder strap are well padded for comfort and protection of your gear. The pack includes a built in micro-fiber cloth and two memory card slots in the main compartment. There's even a tuck-away all-weather cover in the bottom of the bag for inclement weather situations. The dividers in the main compartment are infinitely adjustable and all can be removed/repositioned. The pack includes a  pull-out tripod holder/foot pocket and strapping system on the side of the bag. There's also a separate compartment at the top of the pack for personal items large enough for wallet, keys, an emergency poncho, etc. Also included are two smaller pockets on the  back of the pack suitable for lens pens, notepad, pens, what have you.<br /><br />This bag is huge. Easily as big as most hiking day-packs. There's room for everything and the kitchen sink. Currently I have my old Canon AE-1 with 80-200 mm lens attached. My 55 mm auxiliary lens. A half dozen assorted filters. Cable release. 1:1 reverse adapter AND my Kodak Z-650 point and shoot all in the main compartment.<br /><br />Ease of use is incredible. The shoulder strap and waist belt are widely adjustable for people of almost all sizes. The zippers work flawlessly and fast never catching or hanging. The velcro throughout the pack is quite heavy duty and looks like it will hold up to years of abuse. All you need do is slide the pack from your back to the front of your body and the camera access section is right there. You never have to take the bag off to get at your rig.<br /><br />Those are the pros.<br /><br />Here are just a couple cons:<br />The micro-fiber cloth is not removable. I'm not sure what you could do if it became soiled or stained and needed cleaning. The strap for the tripod is not fixed to the pack and could easily be lost. The all-weather cover fits very tight to the bag (in and of itself this is a good thing, but...) it won't fit over any but the smallest mono-pod or tripod. My [[ASIN:B00005T3TI Ambico 54 Inch Tripod with Quick Release (V-0555)]] just barely fits on the pack.<br /><br />I have no doubt this bag would last years for anyone from amateur to most demanding professional.",5.0,the fit and finish of this bag are top notch ive been camping and backpacking for decades and i have to say the quality of this bag and the workmanship are among the best ive seen the nylon material is heavy duty and durable the bag and shoulder strap are well padded for comfort and protection of your gear the pack includes a built in microfiber cloth and two memory card slots in the main compartment theres even a tuckaway allweather cover in the bottom of the bag for inclement weather situations the dividers in the main compartment are infinitely adjustable and all can be removedrepositioned the pack includes a pullout tripod holderfoot pocket and strapping system on the side of the bag theres also a separate compartment at the top of the pack for personal items large enough for wallet keys an emergency poncho etc also included are two smaller pockets on the back of the pack suitable for lens pens notepad pens what have youbr br this bag is huge easily as big as most hiking daypacks theres room for everything and the kitchen sink currently i have my old canon ae with mm lens attached my mm auxiliary lens a half dozen assorted filters cable release reverse adapter and my kodak z point and shoot all in the main compartmentbr br ease of use is incredible the shoulder strap and waist belt are widely adjustable for people of almost all sizes the zippers work flawlessly and fast never catching or hanging the velcro throughout the pack is quite heavy duty and looks like it will hold up to years of abuse all you need do is slide the pack from your back to the front of your body and the camera access section is right there you never have to take the bag off to get at your rigbr br those are the prosbr br here are just a couple consbr the microfiber cloth is not removable im not sure what you could do if it became soiled or stained and needed cleaning the strap for the tripod is not fixed to the pack and could easily be lost the allweather cover fits very tight to the bag in and of itself this is a good thing but it wont fit over any but the smallest monopod or tripod my asinbtti ambico inch tripod with quick release v just barely fits on the packbr br i have no doubt this bag would last years for anyone from amateur to most demanding professional,2278

"I often get asked what camera to buy, and invariably I point to entry level Nikons.  That's in part due to my familiarity with Nikons (Canon, Pentax, and Sony make nice cameras too), but it's also because Nikon makes great cameras throughout their lineup, and the value is really at the lower end of the lineup.<br /><br />That's especially true here.  You get a great sensor, which honestly has too much resolution for most people's needs.  It's not just the number pixels, as they offer an outstanding image quality and a great deal of ISO flexibility.  If this doesn't mean much to you, that's fine.  It just takes great pictures.<br /><br />The AF is modest compared to higher end Nikons, but it holds its own relative to your needs (which is all that really matters) as well as competitors.  Heck it wasn't long ago that higher end cameras offered no more than this camera offers.  It has some great abilities, but for most people you can just point and shoot.<br /><br />There are a few features that Nikon regulars may want that aren't here:  A true pentaprism (again if you don't know what that means, worry not, as the pentamirror likely will be fine for you), a motor for older AF lenses (anything made in the past 8 or so years is most likely fine anyway, and the included lens is all many will ever use), the ability to control remote flashes, and high speed flash sync.  I kinda miss them all a little, but that's from using a D70s and D90 for the past 7 years.<br /><br />Again Canon, Pentax, and Sony make great SLRs, but Nikon has a strong entry level value proposition.  The balance of excellent image quality, high resolution, and a nice balance of somewhat advanced features in an easy to use (as well as affordable and compact) package is hard to pass up.",5.0,i often get asked what camera to buy and invariably i point to entry level nikons thats in part due to my familiarity with nikons canon pentax and sony make nice cameras too but its also because nikon makes great cameras throughout their lineup and the value is really at the lower end of the lineupbr br thats especially true here you get a great sensor which honestly has too much resolution for most peoples needs its not just the number pixels as they offer an outstanding image quality and a great deal of iso flexibility if this doesnt mean much to you thats fine it just takes great picturesbr br the af is modest compared to higher end nikons but it holds its own relative to your needs which is all that really matters as well as competitors heck it wasnt long ago that higher end cameras offered no more than this camera offers it has some great abilities but for most people you can just point and shootbr br there are a few features that nikon regulars may want that arent here a true pentaprism again if you dont know what that means worry not as the pentamirror likely will be fine for you a motor for older af lenses anything made in the past or so years is most likely fine anyway and the included lens is all many will ever use the ability to control remote flashes and high speed flash sync i kinda miss them all a little but thats from using a ds and d for the past yearsbr br again canon pentax and sony make great slrs but nikon has a strong entry level value proposition the balance of excellent image quality high resolution and a nice balance of somewhat advanced features in an easy to use as well as affordable and compact package is hard to pass up,1675

"Before writing this review I glanced over some reviews of earlier models, and whatever issues previous editions of the Bose SoundTouch speakers may have had seem to have been worked out with this SoundTouch 10.<br /><br />Setup was simple with the SoundTouch app (available for iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire devices). We had the speaker set up and operating in less than 5 minutes using an iPad. You'll need your home network security code to connect to WiFi and that's about it.<br /><br />It comes with a remote, but most of the controlling is done from your device (tablet or phone). The remote is handy for adjusting the volume when you're using your device for other things.<br /><br />The speaker is about the size of a cereal box. The sound that comes out is impressive for its size. I think there's a wee bit of case resonance in the mid range, but that's just me -- everyone else thinks it sounds terrific. It doesn't rival a huge stereo system but it's really, really good.<br /><br />Now excuse me while I get on my soapbox about monaural. This is a single speaker system, not stereo, and that, to me, is a good thing. I'm a fan of monaural. It solves a lot of issues about speaker placement (trying to make sure they're equally distant), and you hear the full mix as the producers and artists intended. You can move anywhere around the room and not have half the mix disappear. And if you like oldies, particularly from the 1960s, this fixes the problems caused by common pan/mix practices from that era (for example, drums and bass panned hard left, guitars and backup singers panned hard right, lead vocals in the middle). If you listen to mixes like that in headphones, you pretty much have to mix the music down in your imagination since bass/drums are exclusively in one ear and keyboards in the other. Some devices don't support mono audio output (I'm looking at you, Windows phone), and as far as I know no one makes a dual-ear mono headset for phones either. So a mono speaker solves the issue. Okay, that's it for the soapbox. Back to the review.<br /><br />The only tone control available in the Bose app is bass volume. But since the sound is well engineered, it's adequate. And bass is very audible. Not subwoofer level audible, but it's very present.<br /><br />The SoundTouch app itself is impressive. It really does make setup a breeze. And the listening options are VAST. Hundreds of radio stations from around the world on WiFi, streaming music services, Pandora, Spotify, and so forth. I used to do a little shortwave listening, and if you're a DXer, this exceeds the capability of SW by far, and every station is digitally clear. And you can connect directly to play music straight from your device.<br /><br />Just to be clear, the speaker itself needs a wall outlet to power it. It's not battery powered. But everything else is wireless. More speakers can be added, but it's so easily unplugged and moved around that one speaker can easily be sufficient.<br /><br />Nice product from Bose.",5.0,before writing this review i glanced over some reviews of earlier models and whatever issues previous editions of the bose soundtouch speakers may have had seem to have been worked out with this soundtouch br br setup was simple with the soundtouch app available for ios android and kindle fire devices we had the speaker set up and operating in less than minutes using an ipad youll need your home network security code to connect to wifi and thats about itbr br it comes with a remote but most of the controlling is done from your device tablet or phone the remote is handy for adjusting the volume when youre using your device for other thingsbr br the speaker is about the size of a cereal box the sound that comes out is impressive for its size i think theres a wee bit of case resonance in the mid range but thats just me everyone else thinks it sounds terrific it doesnt rival a huge stereo system but its really really goodbr br now excuse me while i get on my soapbox about monaural this is a single speaker system not stereo and that to me is a good thing im a fan of monaural it solves a lot of issues about speaker placement trying to make sure theyre equally distant and you hear the full mix as the producers and artists intended you can move anywhere around the room and not have half the mix disappear and if you like oldies particularly from the s this fixes the problems caused by common panmix practices from that era for example drums and bass panned hard left guitars and backup singers panned hard right lead vocals in the middle if you listen to mixes like that in headphones you pretty much have to mix the music down in your imagination since bassdrums are exclusively in one ear and keyboards in the other some devices dont support mono audio output im looking at you windows phone and as far as i know no one makes a dualear mono headset for phones either so a mono speaker solves the issue okay thats it for the soapbox back to the reviewbr br the only tone control available in the bose app is bass volume but since the sound is well engineered its adequate and bass is very audible not subwoofer level audible but its very presentbr br the soundtouch app itself is impressive it really does make setup a breeze and the listening options are vast hundreds of radio stations from around the world on wifi streaming music services pandora spotify and so forth i used to do a little shortwave listening and if youre a dxer this exceeds the capability of sw by far and every station is digitally clear and you can connect directly to play music straight from your devicebr br just to be clear the speaker itself needs a wall outlet to power it its not battery powered but everything else is wireless more speakers can be added but its so easily unplugged and moved around that one speaker can easily be sufficientbr br nice product from bose,2866
"Before I bought this, I had only heard great things about it. People kept talking about how great the performance was, and how innovative the mounting system was. Well, the time finally arrived for me to do a new build. I was already going for top-tier components, so I thought why not? I ordered, and in typical Amazon fashion, the item arrived fast. My first impression was &#34;DAMN THIS THING IS HUGE!&#34; After I was over that, I got everything up and running.<br /><br />Installing it was a breeze. Attach the bracket to the motherboard, and twist some screws on the heatsink. You're done.<br /><br />Performance-wise, it's running my overclocked 6700k running super-cool. And the Noctua fans lives up to their reputation, as they're barely audible at all. I kid you not, I've accidentally hit the power switch on my case a couple times, which activated the shutdown sequence because the computer was already on.<br /><br />The best part is that Noctua as historically provided mountain brackets for new sockets if the current hardware no longer fits if you provide a proof of purchase.

"I was trying to choose. Sony MDR-V6 Sony MDR-7506, ATH-M30, ATH-M40... I looked at everything. I found a youtube channel, which plays direct from CD sample, then crossover in sync to various model headphones resampling the sound from the each headphone as it's placed over a foam head. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj69-mWHV3E - The point is, they are trying to reproduce what is heard. Also, I found another youtube channel of a guy who shows various headphones sampled through a graphic analyzer, showing the frequency response.<br /><br />All headphones add something to the signal. So what you hear on one model isn't the same, with another. But of all the head phones, the ATH-M40x was identical in sound reproduction to the original music. You couldn't tell the difference. Why is this important? Two reasons, if you are an audio engineer, you will have a truer sound, what you hear, is what you will get. It goes both ways, what you listen to, will be what the sound engineer intended for you to hear.<br /><br />For music with base, it has good presence, and you can hear details that sound muddy on other head phones. I have been listening to a lot of head phones. You do understand muddy and clarity, once you hear it.<br /><br />With that said, and having spent some time, in store sampling, (note: I must say that the Sonys are really good too. I tried and liked the MDR-V55 as well. It's a DJ headset so it's a bit more base. I felt they were very clear and better than the MDR-X05 hands down.)<br /><br />The ATH-M40x, has removable cables. They are field repairable. And you can choose between three different cables, although two come in the box.<br /><br />They are son tested and approved. Now I have to keep them locked up, joking. They are well built. Some say the ATH-M50x is better. It's also said the M50x sound the same as last year's model, and the M40x sound as good as last year's M50 model too. Which is it? The M40x is specifically flat sounding for audio engineering. The M50x is targeted for the audiophile, with a V shape EQ. The M40x is in the sweet spot, unless you have money to burn.<br /><br />They are a bit tight, but this may be alleviated by exchanging the ear pads with velour pads. This exchange compromises the sound profile a little bit, but makes them more comfortable. You be the judge. I am still waiting to do it myself.<br /><br />(150220) - I made some spelling corrections, fixed typos and wording, for clarity.",5.0,i was trying to choose sony mdrv sony mdr athm athm i looked at everything i found a youtube channel which plays direct from cd sample then crossover in sync to various model headphones resampling the sound from the each headphone as its placed over a foam head the point is they are trying to reproduce what is heard also i found another youtube channel of a guy who shows various headphones sampled through a graphic analyzer showing the frequency responsebr br all headphones add something to the signal so what you hear on one model isnt the same with another but of all the head phones the athmx was identical in sound reproduction to the original music you couldnt tell the difference why is this important two reasons if you are an audio engineer you will have a truer sound what you hear is what you will get it goes both ways what you listen to will be what the sound engineer intended for you to hearbr br for music with base it has good presence and you can hear details that sound muddy on other head phones i have been listening to a lot of head phones you do understand muddy and clarity once you hear itbr br with that said and having spent some time in store sampling note i must say that the sonys are really good too i tried and liked the mdrv as well its a dj headset so its a bit more base i felt they were very clear and better than the mdrx hands downbr br the athmx has removable cables they are field repairable and you can choose between three different cables although two come in the boxbr br they are son tested and approved now i have to keep them locked up joking they are well built some say the athmx is better its also said the mx sound the same as last years model and the mx sound as good as last years m model too which is it the mx is specifically flat sounding for audio engineering the mx is targeted for the audiophile with a v shape eq the mx is in the sweet spot unless you have money to burnbr br they are a bit tight but this may be alleviated by exchanging the ear pads with velour pads this exchange compromises the sound profile a little bit but makes them more comfortable you be the judge i am still waiting to do it myselfbr br i made some spelling corrections fixed typos and wording for clarity,2246

"This camera will be great for the front window to capture anyone that comes up our walkway to the front door.

It allows rotation left/right and up/down. The rotation is a really cool and useful feature.<br /><br />I love that I can capture images and video. A feature that I do not have with my current cameras. Another plus is that the view is so much more clear than that of my current security cameras.<br /><br />The app: AJ Cloud has a bit of a learning curve. Definitely not intuitive.

"As a programmer, I'll second (and third, and fourth) that making the switch to 4K is something you'll do and you'll never go back.<br /><br />The visuals/brightness/colors are just fine on this monitor for programming.  No bad pixels, and supports the full 60 Hz 4:4:4 (with sufficient graphics card) which would be my only concern along those lines.<br /><br />One thing worthy of note: At first I assumed I'd be using this monitor for programming by placing many application windows on the screen at the same time - kind of like 'FOUR 1920x1080 monitors in one'.  I even tested different window manager programs, and went with WinDivvy (it's great - simple, and works so that with a single key combination you can pop any window to any size / position).<br /><br />However, quickly I shifted into my current mode of work: With the 4K, I now use the monitor in PORTRAIT mode, and only have ONE application window showing at a time, filling the entire screen.  Yes, that means that I still have as many Alt + Tabs as I did with my 1920 x 1080, but you can fit an INCREDIBLE amount of vertical text on the screen with a 38040 x 2160 in PORTRAIT mode.  Just a few Page Up/Page Downs can navigate through an entire thousands-of-lines source code file.<br /><br />Seeing so much code on the screen at one time makes the mental effort SO much easier.  I recommend this monitor in PORTRAIT mode for programmers.<br /><br />You'll need a good monitor arm mount to make any real use of this monitor, so be prepared.

"I received this item through the Amazon Vine program, although the usual green writing may not be shown.  The review is specifically for model: GS305EPP.<br /><br />Port Binding:  I noticed that the Netgear chart shows for the ""plus"" series of switches, that only models with 16 or more ports support port binding.  However, through the web interface, I was able to do a single instance of port binding (it looks like it allows you to bind up to four ports, although I can't think of an instance where binding more than two ports on a five port switch would be worthwhile).  I learned some quirks about port binding in the process, that using 802.3ad with multiple Linux servers doesn't allow for more than a Gb of data in any one direction anyway.  BUT this switch does apparently support balance-rr, because I could get almost 2Gb/s over a 2Gb aggregate link.  I think my hard drives in those machines were maxed out at that point.  As I understand it, balance-rr has a high error rate because it uses striping and not all machines support it.  But it was working quite nicely with my NAS units and this switch (I was expecting the 8 port switch, which would have made that setup more worthwhile because I could fatten the links on all three servers.<br /><br />Although my current Netgear Pro AP does not have two ports for binding, I did have an AP before that supported it, in which case that feature on this switch may be an excellent option (particularly considering it is PoE).  I haven't done the math for myself, but I think that port binding is almost a gimmick on APs because there is so much overhead on WiFi that even if your AP has a throughput in the multi-Gb range, enough of that is overhead created by the AP that you're not actually getting that much data from one computer to another.<br /><br />Insight and Web Interface:  The Insight App shows this switch (and my Netgear APs) as having ""limited support"" (just shows basic device info and a link to the device's webpage), so they're not really trying to get users of the ""plus"" line to subscribe to that in perpetuity.<br /><br />And you don't need the app to use the switch.  You don't even need the configuration page, really:  I just plugged this into my old 24-port unmanaged Netgear workhose and it picked up an IP from the router and worked just like an unmanaged switch until I decided to give it a static IP and manage it.<br /><br />I was really surprised how many features are packed into the management software, considering these are Netgear's lower line of managed devices.  But most of the stuff you'll see on huge enterprise devices is here as well (well, it's been a while since I've been inside the big enterprise stuff, but all those goodies reach us as consumers before long).<br /><br />The web interface is just like any other network device - you can reach it from any webpage and it is super GUI - probably just a little more than I really want it to be, but it is very intuitive and you can find everything with a few clicks.  I say ""super GUI"" just because it looks fancier than I need it to.  And one thing I find a little irritating is that when you expand one box, it collapses another, so you can't look at everything at once.  This doesn't really matter, but I'm old school where I just want substance over style and even style that doesn't sacrifice substance still looks like they're trying too hard.<br /><br />PoE:  Clearly, on this 4+1 port switch, all four of your devices can use a full 30w each, so this is non-blocking in PoE+ as well as throughput.  At time of writing, the 8 port with the same power budget was actually cheaper, so you might consider that, even if you can't use all the ports at full PoE.<br /><br />What is great about this, is that besides just being able to add APs and IP cameras to your network (or even lighting, etc.), you can turn them on and off from the web interface.  So I can keep my main AP on PoE (and therefore on my telecom closet's backup power supply), and then turn my detached garage's AP on and off from the web interface rather than having to go down to the basement and plug or unplug the PoE injector every time I want to use the garage AP (I just turn it on if I'm going to be working out there and might need to watch some ""how-to"" videos or control my audio system from the local LAN).<br /><br />*Netgear, if you're listening, I would love to have a super lightweight (and free) app that works remotely (when not necessarily on LAN) to turn ports on and off for exactly this type of reason.*<br /><br />Construction:  Solid device, very dense and professional looking.  Plenty of lights that tell you a lot from a glance.  Power supply is external and about as big as the device itself.  Would personally love a way to rack mount this AND the power supply (for maximum flexibility) in 1 RU, but of course I realize most people don't want to waste a whole rack unit on 5 ports.  But for the space both pieces take up, it's about a mid size unit that could be mounted with ""wings"".  It does have four-way keyhole mounts for wall-mounting.<br /><br />Background:  I have great experience with Netgear for my home (but way better than most homes') network.  I'd definitely use all their devices were I doing work for small or medium sized businesses.  I like them just a tad less when they start trying to sell you subscriptions (which is what I hate about Brocade and Cisco, along with all the proprietary garbage), but for the most part, Netgear is inexpensive and quite reliable.  I've had a 24 port nonblocking unmanaged Gb switch running 24/7 in my dusty basement for over 15 years without a single fault AND they still sell that model.  Their APs are the best I've had, and I don't think I've ever had a Netgear item break on me, period.  I have had lots of other home/SMB stuff break or otherwise have strange issues, though.<br /><br />That said, there's a lot of no-name PoE switches on the market right now.  I don't need any of those handling my low voltage needs OR my data.  And they won't beat this line on the price by too much anyway.<br /><br />This is an excellent device which adds a lot of versatility to your network.",5.0,i received this item through the amazon vine

"I sometimes record football games for our local high school. One of the requirements is to hand over a dvd of the game for coaches to trade by next morning. Anyone with experience in editing knows that this can be a time consuming task, even more so if you record in HD. I was taking the video home, then capturing it to my editing software and then rendering it out to a DVD compatible format and then burning the DVD. This can take hours. I also had the option to record direct to hard drive using software the school purchased but I had to lug around a laptop and the software still took about an hour to convert and burn. So with all that said the Sony VDR-MC5 has been a life-saver. If you have a Sony HandyCam with a built in hard drive or memory stick you can save ALOT of time (I have the SR-11). The MC5 will burn your video directly to a DVD in about 20 minutes in HD (AVCHD Blu-Ray) format BUT you can only play the DVD on a Blu-Ray compatible DVD player. I found that changing my HandyCam to SD(HQ) mode still gives me great video quality, burns the DVD in about 15 minutes (this is about 1 hour of video I'm using mind you) AND the finished DVD will play on any DVD player. I can hand the coaches a trade DVD within 30 minutes of the last whistle. The MC5 is perfect for fast turn-around.......I love it! Oh and it does so much more but I only covered what I really needed it for. Now I can get to sleep at a reasonable hour. That alone is worth the price!",5.0,i sometimes record football games for our local high school one of the requirements is to hand over a dvd of the game for coaches to trade by next morning anyone with experience in editing knows that this can be a time consuming task even more so if you record in hd i was taking the video home then capturing it to my editing software and then rendering it out to a dvd compatible format and then burning the dvd this can take hours i also had the option to record direct to hard drive using software the school purchased but i had to lug around a laptop and the software still took about an hour to convert and burn so with all that said the sony vdrmc has been a lifesaver if you have a sony handycam with a built in hard drive or memory stick you can save alot of time i have the sr the mc will burn your video directly to a dvd in about minutes in hd avchd bluray format but you can only play the dvd on a bluray compatible dvd player i found that changing my handycam to sdhq mode still gives me great video quality burns the dvd in about minutes this is about hour of video im using mind you and the finished dvd will play on any dvd player i can hand the coaches a trade dvd within minutes of the last whistle the mc is perfect for fast turnaroundi love it oh and it does so much more but i only covered what i really needed it for now i can get to sleep at a reasonable hour that alone is worth the price,1413
"I was looking for a smaller widescreen monitor to use as a 3rd monitor above my two main ones. I also have a shelf on the wall above my monitors so my space is limited.

"Better than paying for a monthly security system but of course won't actually protect your house from break-ins.  Most home systems don't protect your house either but an alarm will often DETER a burglar once the sounds goes off.  They either take off immediately or only grab things within arms length (unless they are professionals).  So this definitely gives me peace of mind without having to pay a monthly fee.  It's also a great security warning if an intruder breaks in while you are home.  Last year we had a home invasion when my husband had just turned in for the night upstairs.  He heard some rustling around and thought I had come home early, then after calling out to me, he heard the sound of several people whispering and scrambling around downstairs.  If we had had this alarm at the time he would have known the moment they enter through the back door.",5.0,better than paying for a monthly security system but of course wont actually protect your house from breakins most home systems dont protect your house either but an alarm will often deter a burglar once the sounds goes off they either take off immediately or only grab things within arms length unless they are professionals so this definitely gives me peace of mind without having to pay a monthly fee its also a great security warning if an intruder breaks in while you are home last year we had a home invasion when my husband had just turned in for the night upstairs he heard some rustling around and thought i had come home early then after calling out to me he heard the sound of several people whispering and scrambling around downstairs if we had had this alarm at the time he would have known the moment they enter through the back door,847

"Before selecting this portable speaker. . . Make sure you’re familiar with all of the B&O portable speaker options, so that you select the one which is going to work best for you.  A little more about each one is shown at the bottom of this review.<br /><br />P2 - Let me start out by saying that I really like this speaker. .  . .but. . . B&O could have done a better job with a couple of things.  First, there are no instructions.  There is a sticker on the speaker advising you to download their app.  If you download their app, then it will walk you through the pairing process and give you a little more information about the speaker and how it works.  There is also a link to the instruction “manual” in the app (which is really a short flyer, just in a lot of different languages).  You can simply do an online search for the Beoplay P2 User Guide to find it as well.  Either way, I recommend you take a look at it to familiarize yourself with the speaker.  If you wish, you do not have to download the app, and can follow the instructions on the User Guide to set it up the speaker.<br /><br />This speaker does not have volume control on the speaker itself.  You must use your phone (or whatever device you’re using) to control the volume.  But you can start / stop the music by tapping the speaker, which is a cool feature.  . .but.  .. the tapping feature works best when the speaker is on a flat surface.  It doesn’t work so well if you’re holding the speaker.  Shake the speaker, and it will advance to the next song.  This speaker also works as a speakerphone.  You’ll want to see the User Guide for the tapping features while using the speakerphone.<br /><br />This is a small “personal” speaker.  Compared to other B&O portable speakers, it’s the lightest of them all. .. albeit still heavier than many other portable speakers. . . at almost 10oz.  It’s heavier because the quality is so much better than other “generic” speakers.<br /><br />This speaker comes with a short USB-A to USB-C charging cord, but does not include an AC adapter.  It has up to a 10-hour battery life, though that’s on the “high end”.  B&O will tell you that the battery life depends upon the type of music you listen to. . . the distance the speaker is from your phone. . . volume. . and so on.  FYI. . . All other B&O portable speakers have up to 24-hours.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little “personal” speaker.  This is NOT a “party speaker” or anything like that.  This speaker does NOT come with a case, though one can be purchased separately.<br /><br />Other B&O portable speaker options. .  . .<br /><br />B&O A1 – This is one step up from the P2.  It’s still very much a “personal” speaker.  It’s round and 5.25” across.  It’s a bit heavier than the P2 at 1-pound 5oz.  It offers volume controls on the speaker itself (though very hard to see), and a bit more “power” overall.<br />[[ASIN:B01DO9KW38 B&O PLAY by Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker with Microphone (Natural)]]<br /><br />B&O A2 – Though still quite portable, it’s a bit larger at 5.6 X 10.1” and 2.4#.  It has a “flat” design.  This is a two-sided speaker, so it works quite nicely on a patio. . . boat. . . smaller room. . . and so on.  An older version of this speaker may also still be available, but you want the newer version which is called “A2 Active”.<br />[[ASIN:B01M1CVNJU B&O PLAY by Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A2 Active Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Stone Grey]]<br /><br />Beolit 17 – This is the most powerful of all current B&O portable speakers.  It’s square / oblong shape measures 9X7.4X5.3” and has a weight of 5#.  It has speakers on all four sides with 240W peak power.  This speaker works nicely in larger rooms as well as outdoors on a patio.

Does not interfere with my sunglasses on runs. Good quality audio and battery life. The normal earbud covers work well for me.

"Let's begin with the cons:<br />This is NOT an Android tablet, even tho it looks like it. You CAN NOT download apps from the Google Play Store (at least, not without jumping through some hoops), the apps available on the Amazon Apps are sorely lacking in some areas (many of the apps I use and really like on Google Play are not available), the OS is slow and clumsy, the home screen is not particularly user friendly and the HOME button is only accessed through a screen, not a dedicated button, which makes it a pain in the butt (sometimes, not always.)<br />Now, for the pros:<br />Good size for a personal tablet, very durable screen and housing, and the biggest pro is the price! I got mine on sale for $39.99, and for that price, I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot. I'm disappointed with the OS, but as a starter-level tablet, if you want to read books, surf the internet, check your email and engage in social networking, it's fine. I RECOMMEND it, even at the full price of $49.99, because for that price, you are NOT going to find any kind of name-brand table (BEWARE OF THE WEIRD, OFF-BRAND TABLETS! I'VE BOUGHT 3 FOR GRANDDAUGHTER'S USE WHEN THEY COME TO VISIT, AND NOT A SINGLE ONE LASTED MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS) for even a third of the price.

"This unit makes talking between a motorcycle's driver and passenger so easy.  It is not high tech, but it works great for the price.  My husband and I have been using one for years.  In fact, when our first unit finally died, we purchased another one.  As the passenger, I wear the unit on my belt or in a jacket pocket.  I then plug in our mics after we are both on the bike and settled.<br /><br />The mics are fairly sensitive so you hear your partner's voice clearly. It will pick up some wind noise or heavy breathing. We use full face helmets so the wind has never been a problem.<br /><br />Don't buy it for the radio. The radio works, but doesn't pull in many stations (at least not in my area)and not clearly. The vox feature does work, but since the radio isn't great, we never use that feature anyway.<br /><br />It takes a little trial and error the first time out to learn where to place the bendable mouthpiece/earpiece in your helmet for best speach clarity and hearing.

"Navigating on a pc screen requires a mouse of some sort. They have come a long way over the years, with more features and more comfort. One that is great for those who like to add a little color to their navigation is this wireless mouse from PEIOUS.<br /><br />Shaped for your hands, this mouse is comfortable to hold and click. It’s easy enough to use and you can’t feel any strain on your hands, so it earns good marks there. But the feature that is most appealing is the lights. You can change the lights to different modes and even shut them off completely, if you prefer. I like that the lights are soft- you notice them, but they are not so bright that they distract from what you are doing.<br /><br />The bluetooth works okay on this mouse and one of the more unusual features is that you have to plug it in to charge. With most others I have used, you need to supply batteries, but this one charges by plugging it into a usb outlet. It’s nice not to have to buy batteries, but it also means you need to have a usb nearby for charging purposes. I consider this feature a plus, as I hate having to search for batteries when the need arises.<br /><br />To conserve power with this mouse, there is a switch to shut it off. Plus, it will automatically shut off, to preserve power, if there is no movement for several minutes. This is good because, with regular use, you will need to recharge this more than you realize and saving power makes a difference.<br /><br />Computers need a means for navigation and that requires a mouse of one type or another. You could go for the boring, ordinary mouse with buttons to click and nothing more, or you could have a little fun and get this wireless mouse from PEIOUS. I vote for the latter. It might only be a mouse, but the lights and the elimination of batteries make this a standout mouse and one I recommend.",5.0,navigating on a pc screen requires a mouse of some sort they have come a long way over the years with more features and more comfort one that is great for those who like to add a little color to their navigation is this wireless mouse from peiousbr br shaped for your hands this mouse is comfortable to hold and click its easy enough to use and you cant feel any strain on your hands so it earns good marks there but the feature that is most appealing is the lights you can change the lights to different modes and even shut them off completely if you prefer i like that the lights are soft you notice them but they are not so bright that they distract from what you are doingbr br the bluetooth works okay on this mouse and one of the more unusual features is that you have to plug it in to charge with most others i have used you need to supply batteries but this one charges by plugging it into a usb outlet its nice not to have to buy batteries but it also means you need to have a usb nearby for charging purposes i consider this feature a plus as i hate having to search for batteries when the need arisesbr br to conserve power with this mouse there is a switch to shut it off plus it will automatically shut off to preserve power if there is no movement for several minutes this is good because with regular use you will need to recharge this more than you realize and saving power makes a differencebr br computers need a means for navigation and that requires a mouse of one type or another you could go for the boring ordinary mouse with buttons to click and nothing more or you could have a little fun and get this wireless mouse from peious i vote for the latter it might only be a mouse but the lights and the elimination of batteries make this a standout mouse and one i recommend,1795

"Despite the fact that I worked for Motorola for several years and went through an inordinate amount of layoffs and rehires, I still swear by their products.(As corny as it may sound.)They  continue to manufacture great cellular phones and devices. (I also have a V600 series phone.)  I initially purchased the Motorola HS850, and although it was comfortable and had decent talk-time, I didn't like the fact that I had to constantly recharge the headset every day.  I actually think the reception of the HS805 is comparable to that of the HS850.  I can typically move about in a 20 ft. radius and still have perfect reception.  I have also found that it works well as a hands-free device in my car.  I absolutely love this bluetooth headset...the battery life is great and I find it easy and convenient to replace the battery with a rechargeable Ni-Mh. Initially I was worried that the headset might be heavy since it takes a AAA battery but the only real weight comes from the battery itself. It's very comfortable, light and seemingly durable.

"After the couch, clothes dryer or my kids ate my last four pairs of earbuds, I was reduced to using a pair of 17 year old, over-the-ear foam headphones that my husband unearthed from somewhere. Then everyone was complaining that they could hear my Queen music and cat videos from across the room. I was also hearing too many of their important discussions, such as determining who farted three days ago in Target or who stuffed 12 candy wrappers into the cushions of the reclining rocking chair. So I ordered these.<br /><br />So glad I got these! The flexible ear cups are great. It turns out that my ear holes are &#34;small,&#34; but this set comes with three sizes of flexible cups, so I just took off the mediums and put the smalls on.<br /><br />These actually transmit the bass sounds and drum beats, unlike the sponges I had been wearing. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that &#34;Don't Stop Me Now&#34; has bass in it! Moreover, I cannot hear my kids reviewing &#34;Ryan's toy review&#34; or asking for the ninth time in 14 minutes what is for dinner tomorrow.

"I'm a musician and I have a home studio setup. I needed to upgrade my studio headphones, so I went with<br />Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio. This might be the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon. I was skeptical at first of the outstanding reviews, but after many hours of researching the best headphones for under $200, I then decided to go with these. I love the clarity and the tight bass is pure and not overly exaggerated. Some of the reviewers here complained of these headphones sounding &#34;tinny&#34; and lacking bass. Well, there are equalizers if you require an insane amount of bass. The bass is just right in my honest opinion and as I have stated previously the bass is tight and accurate.. If you are on the fence about getting these headphones like I was... fear not I definitely recommend these for both the studio and for listening to music. I'm even recommending these to my family and friends. The<br />Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is also great for games! The sound quality is outstanding on my Mbox 3, Ipod 5th generation video and Iphone 5S.<br /><br />UPDATE as of 12/6/2016 - I'm so thrilled I chose to go with these headphones. I have no regrets about this purchase and I have been rocking out with these headphones with no problems whatsoever. Trust me and just buy these headphones. The sound is pure and amazing.

"Many of us would like to use our computer in a certain room or area of the house, but it really is too expensive, or too difficult, or not practical to run Cat5/6 Cable to the location (drilling holes, going through walls, floors, ceilings, etc.). There are also those situations, because of building structure and/or materials that wireless tends to drop internet connections or is unable to supply a desired or required amount of bandwidth.<br /><br />In my own case, a few years ago, I needed a solution to bring the Internet to the 3rd floor of a 140 year-old building, which had wiring (only two-prong) more than just a few decades old. From previous experience, I knew wireless would not work (at least work well). There was also little or no hope, in the near future, of running a CAT5/6 line for a hardwired connection.<br /><br />A fair amount of research first led me to find the [[ASIN:B001J2ZSL4 Cisco-Linksys PLK300 PowerLine AV Ethernet Adapter Kit]] (made up of two Cisco-Linksys devices: PLE300 & PLS300 network adapters). I was a skeptic, but the reviews on Amazon.com and other sites convinced me to give it a try. Because of this product, I had Internet service the same day the product was delivered. The PLE300 plugs into your router or switch and an electrical receptacle. The PLS300 plugs in a wall receptacle where you want to use the network/Internet. The PLS300 is a four-port adapter (having 4 RJ-45 connectors), acting like a normal switch, giving Network/Internet access to 4 computers or any other network devices.<br /><br />Since then, I have updated (actually added) several components to the network including this [[ASIN:B007ILFFS6 Netgear XAVB5101 Powerline Nano500 Set(XAVB5101)]]. One of the units in the set replaces the above Cisco-Linksys PLE300 router connection. The other unit is now connected to my computer, replacing the PLS300 (now used elsewhere). The network connection appears as 1.0Gbps, but I am sure that these units go nowhere near this speed. While the Cisco had boasted of up to 200Mbps data rates, these claim speeds up to 500 Mbps. There is a very noticeable difference in how quickly the monitor displays a screen. I find them impressive! Plus, it's all Plug and Play!<br /><br />Besides these Powerline adapters, I know of no other solution that provides Internet access to any part of a home or office so quickly and efficiently. The network is easily expandable by plugging additional single-port adapters into electrical outlets anywhere in the building controlled by the same electrical service. A network switch like [[ASIN:B0000BVYT3 NETGEAR GS105 ProSafe 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Desktop Switch - 10/100/1000 Mbps]] can then be plugged into the adapter, as I am doing, to allow several devices access to the network/Internet. From a user's standpoint, you should experience Internet speeds comparable to what any cable or DSL service provides. These are fast enough to watch streaming HD video from Netflix or other services on internet-ready HD TVs. It's cleaner and easier than most other solutions.<br /><br />Since initially buying my first Powerline adapters, there have been many companies that have have gotten into the ""powerline"" market. Cisco/Linksys, Netgear, and Monster are just a few. A little research and reviews can point to many accessories that are compatible and backwards compatible with the Homeplug AV technology standard used in these products. This also competes with products like the [[ASIN:B003VWY0VY Western Digital WD Livewire Powerline AV Network Kit]].",5.0,many of us would like to use our computer in a certain room or area of the house but it really is too expensive or too difficult or not practical to run cat cable to the location drilling holes going through walls floors ceilings etc there are also those situations because of building structure andor materials that wireless tends to drop internet connections or is unable to supply a desired or required amount of bandwidthbr br in my own case a few years ago i needed a solution to bring the internet to the rd floor of a yearold building which had wiring only twoprong more than just a few decades old from previous experience i knew wireless would not work at least work well there was also little or no hope in the near future of running a cat line for a hardwired connectionbr br a fair amount of research first led me to find the asinbjzsl ciscolinksys plk powerline av ethernet adapter kit made up of two ciscolinksys devices ple pls network adapters i was a skeptic but the reviews on amazoncom and other sites convinced me to give it a try because of this product i had internet service the same day the product was delivered the ple plugs into your router or switch and an electrical receptacle the pls plugs in a wall receptacle where you want to use the networkinternet the pls is a fourport adapter having rj connectors acting like a normal switch giving networkinternet access to computers or any other network devicesbr br since then i have updated actually added several components to the network including this asinbilffs netgear xavb powerline nano setxavb one of the units in the set replaces the above ciscolinksys ple router connection the other unit is now connected to my computer replacing the pls now used elsewhere the network connection appears as gbps but i am sure that these units go nowhere near this speed while the cisco had boasted of up to mbps data rates these claim speeds up to mbps there is a very noticeable difference in how quickly the monitor displays a screen i find them impressive plus its all plug and playbr br besides these powerline adapters i know of no other solution that provides internet access to any part of a home or office so quickly and efficiently the network is easily expandable by plugging additional singleport adapters into electrical outlets anywhere in the building controlled by the same electrical service a network switch like asinbbvyt netgear gs prosafe port gigabit ethernet desktop switch mbps can then be plugged into the adapter as i am doing to allow several devices access to the networkinternet from a users standpoint you should experience internet speeds comparable to what any cable or dsl service provides these are fast enough to watch streaming hd video from netflix or other services on internetready hd tvs its cleaner and easier than most other solutionsbr br since initially buying my first powerline adapters there have been many companies that have have gotten into the powerline market ciscolinksys netgear and monster are just a few a little research and reviews can point to many accessories that are compatible and backwards compatible with the homeplug av technology standard used in these products this also competes with products like the asinbvwyvy western digital wd livewire powerline av network kit,3303
Ok I'm not a professional but my sister is and she said it was amazing and from my use this light is hands down worth every penny I'm buying another one asap. Battery life is beyond a hour on MAX I use it with 4k30fps and color and saturation is amazing and looks closest to daylight than any indoor lighting. Indoors you can have it ar the first setting for casual part recording and go up from there fro production quality lighting.  I even used it for a lamp when doing a tattoo in a low light situation and it was perfect natural lighting. The diffuser is what makes this light so great with any camera application. Maybe some color gels over the diffuser would be a great effect too.  Well I'm rambling.

"Exactly what it looks like. If you have a laptop with no numpad or a small factor keyboard, this is a great way to go. The price is better than a build your own kit, which surprised me a bit but whatever. It does have soldered in cherry MX style knock off switches so if you want to lube them or the stabilizers you are gonna have to get some equipment out. The keys are scratchy and loud, the stabs rattle but for the tiny price tag and almost immediate delivery I don't count it as a negative. The lighting is fine but I keep it off or low, the num lock button lights up to tell you it is on or off. It has a few extra functions on it for tab and backspace/parentheses so it actually makes a lot of sense if you work with spread sheets a lot. In an office setting it might be a bit loud and if I get bored I might mod it to be quieter one day but mech key sounds don't bother me much.<br /><br />I have it set up as keyboard > mouse > numpad. I really like this as I can type and reach the mouse with very little movement, but once I start a spreadsheet I can full commit to the pad and mouse with my right side, it feels like it makes more sense.

"Let me start by saying I am a great fan of the Panasonic Lumix FZ range: After using film SLRs since the 1970's, I dipped my toe in the water of digital photography in 2006 with the 5 Mp FZ12 (Oh the joy of having a 36 - 400 mm plus zoom without all the pain & hassles of lugging the weight of a camera body plus all the heavy lenses around!), then progressed to the 8 Mp FZ16 (28 x 504 mm equivalent) in 2008, & the 14 Mp FZ40 (25 x 600mm) in 2011. I found each camera to be an improvement on the previous, & the quality of the images adequate to very good, depending on conditions. I also find the controls to be intuitive so I rarely need to take my eye off of my subject when I'm taking a shot.  It was always my intention to at some point upgrade to a DSLR, but the convenience & quality of the FZ range (not to mention the cost & weight of an equivalent DSLR system) has kept me from doing so. That said, I always felt I was making a few compromises - mainly in terms of low light performance & the inability to add an external flash, macro lens or remote shutter release. The majority of my photography is macro, & the addition of a Raynox DCR converter [[ASIN:B000A1SZ2Y Raynox DCR 250 Super Macro Snap On]] a couple of years ago has increased the range & flexibility of my photography immensely.<br /><br />Enter the FZ200 - this camera has a similar intuitive layout to the FZ40 but feels more robust. The pop-up flash is much more powerful than previous models (actually a downside for me as taking night time macros it is a little too powerful, even with the exposure comp maxed out so I'm experimenting with opaque tape over the flash lens) & it also has a hot-shoe enabling the addition of an external flash unit - I've added a Nissin Speedlite Di 466 FT  [[ASIN:B003LWH156 B003LWH156]] which will be a huge improvement for people shots. The biggest improvement though is having an F2.8 max aperture throughout the focal ranges - I've been taking night-time macros without flash by using a small flashlight to light my subjects & the images are more than acceptable. I take a lot of low light shots & FZ200 allows me to do this at reasonably low ISOs, so the images are much less grainy than the previous models I've owned. The lens quality appears to be excellent, & even at full zoom there looks to be minimal degradation of images at the edges - an issue with the other models.<br /><br />Although obviously image quality from a bridge camera will never completely match that of a good DSLR due to the smaller sensor size, unless you are going to be looking to sell large format prints that shouldn't be an issue. I've had several photos I've taken with my previous Lumix FZs featured by National Geographic on their website, & I've won contests in competition with many SLR users. I know there is a certain amount of snobbery around bridge cameras like this (even though many DSLR users I know never take them out of the Automatic setting!) but for me their quality is outstanding for the price & they are so much more convenient & flexible (especially with the addition of the snap-on Raynox macro converter) - I never miss a shot because I'm busy changing a lens!",5.0,let me start by saying i am a great fan of the panasonic lumix fz range after using film slrs since the s i dipped my toe in the water of digital photography in with the mp fz oh the joy of having a mm plus zoom without all the pain hassles of lugging the weight of a camera body plus all the heavy lenses around then progressed to the mp fz x mm equivalent in the mp fz x mm in i found each camera to be an improvement on the previous the quality of the images adequate to very good depending on conditions i also find the controls to be intuitive so i rarely need to take my eye off of my subject when im taking a shot it was always my intention to at some point upgrade to a dslr but the convenience quality of the fz range not to mention the cost weight of an equivalent dslr system has kept me from doing so that said i always felt i was making a few compromises mainly in terms of low light performance the inability to add an external flash macro lens or remote shutter release the majority of my photography is macro the addition of a raynox dcr converter asinbaszy raynox dcr super macro snap on a couple of years ago has increased the range flexibility of my photography immenselybr br enter the fz this camera has a similar intuitive layout to the fz but feels more robust the popup flash is much more powerful than previous models actually a downside for me as taking night time macros it is a little too powerful even with the exposure comp maxed out so im experimenting with opaque tape over the flash lens it also has a hotshoe enabling the addition of an external flash unit ive added a nissin speedlite di ft asinblwh blwh which will be a huge improvement for people shots the biggest improvement though is having an f max aperture throughout the focal ranges ive been taking nighttime macros without flash by using a small flashlight to light my subjects the images are more than acceptable i take a lot of low light shots fz allows me to do this at reasonably low isos so the images are much less grainy than the previous models ive owned the lens quality appears to be excellent even at full zoom there looks to be minimal degradation of images at the edges an issue with the other modelsbr br although obviously image quality from a bridge camera will never completely match that of a good dslr due to the smaller sensor size unless you are going to be looking to sell large format prints that shouldnt be an issue ive had several photos ive taken with my previous lumix fzs featured by national geographic on their website ive won contests in competition with many slr users i know there is a certain amount of snobbery around bridge cameras like this even though many dslr users i know never take them out of the automatic setting but for me their quality is outstanding for the price they are so much more convenient flexible especially with the addition of the snapon raynox macro converter i never miss a shot because im busy changing a lens,2967

If youre looking for full coverage?  Look no further! This is the best ipad car I've bought.  I actually bought it to put on my son's ipad.

Which is great for falling protection and it also helps with him griping it.  This is just a great case overall.  Now I don't have to worry about him dropping his ipad. Who am I kidding lol.

"Got this for my 3d printer, it fixed all my problems. My kit came with a 180w and I had Y shfiting through prints. Stepper didn't have enough torque and the board controlling it was giving me issues. Turns out the 180w could only get up to 8.1V under load.

"I have owned a large number of ear bud style headphones over the last 25 plus years.  They have been from a diverse number of manufactures including Philips, Sony, Apple, and many others.  I have also had many types of full size headphones in the last 45 years including esoteric types such as electrostatic from Stax and Koss.<br /><br />I have a wide range of electronic equipment from the latest, state of the art home theater to modified tube amps and electrostatic speakers.  I have never heard a pair of ear buds that were in any way acceptable acoustically until I heard the JLabs J4s.  The J4s are amazing, stunning buds.  They come with seven sizes of ear cushions for a custom fit to your ear.  The important step in obtaining the excellent sound these buds are capable of is to select the proper cushions.  They must fit into your ear properly and it is worth it to take the time to find the proper fit.  J4s are also the first bud with replaceable cushions that actually stay on their plastic post in all conditions.  I have had many buds where the cushion has fallen off never to be seen again or have stayed in my ear when I took the buds off.<br /><br />The build quality of the J4s is higher than any bud I have ever seen.  The cord is truly tangle-free and the plugs and connections are reinforced for a long service life.  The case that comes with them is a little on the large size but that is because it is made of very heavy duty materials.  Its size does allow storage of small players with the buds.<br /><br />But onto the sound.  The first time I put these buds in my ear and turned on my ipod I was just blown away.  I didn't think any bud was capable of sound quality like these reproduce.  They actually supply bass that you can feel and the mid-range and highs are well balanced for incredible overall music balance.  The sound is clear enough that you will hear stuff you have never heard before.  For example, the slight delay between two drum sticks striking a drum is clearly audible - something I have never heard in other buds.  Since I have had these buds I just don't want to stop listening to music.  When I am listening I keep thinking that I should recommend a song that just came on as one that showcases these incredible buds.  But the next song and the next song sound great as well.  The overall sound is so well balanced and clear that I often can't believe that I am listening to something so small.  All my sources such as several MP3 players, laptop, and other devices sound terrific with the J4s.<br /><br />With the solid, strong construction, along with absolutely stunning sound I highly recommend the JLab J4 buds.  They make the other buds I have like Apple, Sony, and others sound tinny and cheap.  I cannot say enough good things about them.",5.0,i have owned a large number of ear bud style headphones over the last plus years they have been from a diverse number of manufactures including philips sony apple and many others i have also had many types of full size headphones in the last years including esoteric types such as electrostatic from stax and kossbr br i have a wide range of electronic equipment from the latest state of the art home theater to modified tube amps and electrostatic speakers i have never heard a pair of ear buds that were in any way acceptable acoustically until i heard the jlabs js the js are amazing stunning buds they come with seven sizes of ear cushions for a custom fit to your ear the important step in obtaining the excellent sound these buds are capable of is to select the proper cushions they must fit into your ear properly and it is worth it to take the time to find the proper fit js are also the first bud with replaceable cushions that actually stay on their plastic post in all conditions i have had many buds where the cushion has fallen off never to be seen again or have stayed in my ear when i took the buds offbr br the build quality of the js is higher than any bud i have ever seen the cord is truly tanglefree and the plugs and connections are reinforced for a long service life the case that comes with them is a little on the large size but that is because it is made of very heavy duty materials its size does allow storage of small players with the budsbr br but onto the sound the first time i put these buds in my ear and turned on my ipod i was just blown away i didnt think any bud was capable of sound quality like these reproduce they actually supply bass that you can feel and the midrange and highs are well balanced for incredible overall music balance the sound is clear enough that you will hear stuff you have never heard before for example the slight delay between two drum sticks striking a drum is clearly audible something i have never heard in other buds since i have had these buds i just dont want to stop listening to music when i am listening i keep thinking that i should recommend a song that just came on as one that showcases these incredible buds but the next song and the next song sound great as well the overall sound is so well balanced and clear that i often cant believe that i am listening to something so small all my sources such as several mp players laptop and other devices sound terrific with the jsbr br with the solid strong construction along with absolutely stunning sound i highly recommend the jlab j buds they make the other buds i have like apple sony and others sound tinny and cheap i cannot say enough good things about them,2688

"I've been following this watch for a while, reading the reviews, which are mostly mixed, but I honestly can't identify with the cons that are griped about in some of these reviews. First of all, it WORKS, and works well. You get the latest version of Android Wear, which is vastly improved, and includes the ability to use wifi connectivity to get notifications from your phone when out of Bluetooth range, which works REALLY WELL. It also turns the wifi function on or off depending if you have a Bluetooth connection with your smartphone, which extends battery life.<br /><br />And speaking of battery life, I've tried the Moto 360, the Gear Live and Gear Fit, and the problem, just like with the Apple watch is that you pretty much have to charge it every single evening. Well, I'm pleased to say that the Urbane can go two days of FULL USE (display always on, all notifications on, wifi on, bright display, etc.)! For ONCE I don't have to worry about whether my smart watch is going to last the day or not. For example, I wore it for a full 24 hours (yes, even while sleeping) , and by noon the following day it still had 54% charge left. While that doesn't match the Pebble's 7-10 days between charges, the Urbane sports an absolute gorgeous PLED display that looks incredible.<br /><br />The styling is the best of any smartwatch I've seen, including the Apple watch, at least in my opinion, because it has a round face, classic stainless steel in silver or gold, and a premium watch band. Oh, and you can place any watch band of 22mm if you want to further personalize it.<br /><br />While it doesn't have 1000s of apps like the iWatch, it is distinguished by the superb speed, responsiveness, and features that the Apple watch hasn't implemented very well yet.<br /><br />It's been awhile since I've been blown away by a product, and never completely by a smartwatch. I am exceptionally pleased with the LG Watch Urbane.",5.0,ive been following this watch for a while reading the reviews which are mostly mixed but i honestly cant identify with the cons that are griped about in some of these reviews first of all it works and works well you get the latest version of android wear which is vastly improved and includes the ability to use wifi connectivity to get notifications from your phone when out of bluetooth range which works really well it also turns the wifi function on or off depending if you have a bluetooth connection with your smartphone which extends battery lifebr br and speaking of battery life ive tried the moto the gear live and gear fit and the problem just like with the apple watch is that you pretty much have to charge it every single evening well im pleased to say that the urbane can go two days of full use display always on all notifications on wifi on bright display etc for once i dont have to worry about whether my smart watch is going to last the day or not for example i wore it for a full hours yes even while sleeping and by noon the following day it still had charge left while that doesnt match the pebbles days between charges the urbane sports an absolute gorgeous pled display that looks incrediblebr br the styling is the best of any smartwatch ive seen including the apple watch at least in my opinion because it has a round face classic stainless steel in silver or gold and a premium watch band oh and you can place any watch band of mm if you want to further personalize itbr br while it doesnt have s of apps like the iwatch it is distinguished by the superb speed responsiveness and features that the apple watch hasnt implemented very well yetbr br its been awhile since ive been blown away by a product and never completely by a smartwatch i am exceptionally pleased with the lg watch urbane,1818

"I've had my new Kindle for a few weeks now, and I LOVE it.<br /><br />I had the 5th generation before, with the side buttons and the ones on the front. It wasn't dying, but I wanted an upgrade and I was able to give my old one to my kid sister so that she could travel with a library in her bag.<br /><br />The only issue I have with the touch-screen Kindle is that it seems to be almost TOO sensitive. I vape, and anytime my &#34;smoke&#34; hits the screen, the font size changes. I have no idea why this is, but it happens. The other thing is that anytime I set the Kindle down on a metal surface--like the side of my stove, or the metal wastebasket in my bathroom--it goes into standby mode.<br /><br />Honestly, I find these issues more amusing than anything, so I'm not too bothered by it overall.<br /><br />I am REALLY, REALLY happy with the Goodreads link system and the timer that lets you know how much longer you should expect to be on a chapter or the book entirely. Now when I'm reading a really good book and glance at the clock to calculate how much sleep I'll have before work, I can do it within a smaller margin of error. It helps with my neurosis.<br /><br />Overal, I'm loving this. I would recommend it to everyone. The glare-free screen is perfect.

"Great little RGB light.  Comes with one of those fantastic silicone diffusers, too.  Has all the features I've come to expect from these small LED lights and does not disappoint.  Going to be an all-purpose backup light for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Tripod - It's really a great design.  Very sturdy, too.  Can be locked in place and has a decent ball-joint mount at the top.  Wide footing means it isn't going to tip over when I use it on the carpet. Also has a phone mount and a shoe mount to get things stacked up.  Extends quite a bit, too.<br />FX - Has all the lighting effects I expect from one of these style lights.  Lightning, candle, emergency vehicles, and color rotation.  Very easy to set different colors, saturation, and brightness.<br />Diffuser - This is the second light I've picked up with the silicone diffuser.  It makes a HUGE difference in my lighting.  I have a small one on top of my camera for close-up shots in my videos, and I am considering using this one up there instead.  It's a little loose at the top, but it doesn't seem like it's going to fall off.<br />Suction Cup - The suction cup mount works GREAT.  I've got it attached to the back of my screen for when I need to get on video conferences.  Very sturdy, AND it is going to be compatible with other items I might need to mount, too.  Will be perfect for my webcam when I'm using my light elsewhere.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Short USB-C Cable.  It's VERY short.  Not a big deal because I have dozens, but it is something to be aware of.<br />Shoe mount - It's plastic.  Seems to work just fine, but over time it might need to be replaced with a metal one.  For office use, though, it's going to last years.<br /><br />My intended purpose for this light is as a back-light for my stop motion videos.  A three-point lighting setup is needed for this scenario, and this one is a great third light.  With the brightness and saturation, this puts off just the right kind of light I needed.

"This is a great lens.  Close focus is unbelievable, 100% crop is crystal clear.  I'll put a rose picture in the pictures above that is 100% crop and you can see for yourself.  I am having lots of fun with this lens as it is a perfect prime.  Many don't know, but 50mm is not the true representation of the human eye.  40mm is the perfect length if you want to mimic what the eye really sees.

The IS on the Oly makes this a wonderful low light lens, I haven't had to use the flash once for party pics and for holiday celebrations.  Saved me from buying an expensive faster lens.  It is the perfect walk around lens as it is small and light.

"My husband old iPad finally became obsolete but he could not bring himself to spend as much money as the newer models cost.  He was going to buy a samsung tablet but I convinced him to get an android tablet instead as he has not had great luck with samsung products of late.  When I found this one at this price point he didn’t believe it would be very good.  But now that he has his new android tablet up and running he is so happy I convinced him to get this one.  It works great and being an android tablet with google it is so easy to learn.  He is still getting the hang of the power and volume buttons being in a totally different position, but he has been using this new tablet for hours a day.<br /><br />It came with a keypad built into the case and he likes being able to type like on a regular keyboard but some of his apps will only play in the vertical position so the keyboard isn’t useable when using those few apps.<br /><br />There are loads of great apps pre-installed that he uses regularly and he likes that he didn’t have to go searching for each of those apps to download.  Because it is a google platform he was able to quickly get up and running during set up using his google profile.  He loves the big screen too.  Even with all of his use he has not needed to recharge the battery yet so it must be a pretty large capacity battery.<br /><br />We are very pleased and will be recommending this tablet for our grandkids too.",5.0,my husband old ipad finally became obsolete but he could not bring himself to spend as much money as the newer models cost he was going to buy a samsung tablet but i convinced him to get an android tablet instead as he has not had great luck with samsung products of late when i found this one at this price point he didnt believe it would be very good but now that he has his new android tablet up and running he is so happy i convinced him to get this one it works great and being an android tablet with google it is so easy to learn he is still getting the hang of the power and volume buttons being in a totally different position but he has been using this new tablet for hours a daybr br it came with a keypad built into the case and he likes being able to type like on a regular keyboard but some of his apps will only play in the vertical position so the keyboard isnt useable when using those few appsbr br there are loads of great apps preinstalled that he uses regularly and he likes that he didnt have to go searching for each of those apps to download because it is a google platform he was able to quickly get up and running during set up using his google profile he loves the big screen too even with all of his use he has not needed to recharge the battery yet so it must be a pretty large capacity batterybr br we are very pleased and will be recommending this tablet for our grandkids too,1406

"I purchased a new car (2022) that had CarPlay only when connected with a cable, which sucks especially with so many technological advances, but I digress......<br /><br />I hate connecting with a cable, since the cable always gets in the way.  I wanted to buy something that was a quality, wireless product that would last more than just a few months.  I found this product on a techie website, which came highly recommended, and this adapter works so well!  You have to connect it to the USB port that you typically would plug your cable in to (you can't just plug it into any USB port).  I plug mine into a port in my center console and it works really well.  If you purchase this, be aware that it is not an instantaneous connection and takes about 15-20 seconds to go through the steps of connecting to the car and then connecting to your phone but works like a charm.  Since I bought this over a month ago, I had 1 little hiccup with it where it wouldn't find the car, so I unplugged it for a few seconds and when I plugged it back in, it went through the connection steps.<br /><br />Since the original purchase, I have bought 3 more for our other cars and for my mother.  The first 2 were at a higher price but had a bigger discount and the last two were at a cheaper price with a cheaper discount.

"Ok, I bought this antenna after trying one if those that sticks flat to the window and it's suppose to pick up channels from miles away (didn't work). I read a lot of reviews and articles and found the ANTOP TV antenna. I was skeptical at first and desperately looking to cut the cord from my cable provider and paying a small fortune every year.  I kept my cable service on for 3 months, just below my return window. To my pleasant surprise, this antenna works better than my cable service and provides me many more channels as well.<br /><br />So I live in SW Florida and nearly 3 months ago we got hit by a massive hurricane. After the hurricane our cable service was interrupted for a long while. However, the ANTOP antenna was able to pick up all the news channels which was very helpful.<br /><br />In addition, one if the reasons why I believe it was difficult for me to receive a good reception is because I live in a condominium complex and on the first floor. I'm sure if I lived in a higher floor, I would receive a better reception.<br /><br />The size of the antenna is pretty big. You have to be creative to hide it if you'reinstallingit inside, but as you can see on my pictures, you can't really tell is there unless I point it out.<br /><br />Overall, I give it a 5 star, but wished it was cheaper.<br /><br />Even though this antenna is a bit on the costly side, it's worth it!

"Love the bold red cable as it makes it easier to spot amongst the tangle of black and white cables we have. The first week I had it I carried it in my Switch case, and used it for both my Switch and Note8. Worked great. Tested it on our 2016 MBP as well and it worked fine; didn't charge as quickly as Apple's own charger, but for USB 3.1 it charged fast enough.<br /><br />Now I keep it in my car as my car charger for my phone while driving. The cable is long enough to reach the USB ports in the middle console, but I'm able to leave it in the adapter near the front console while the phone is held on by the vent mount.

"Happy with the Flexbook Keyboard Case. Folks this is an item you should buy. I can’t say enough about this product. First, I prefer using a keyboard especially when typing emails. At night the Flexbook will illuminate and you stare at the keys and type etc, be aware there s no trackball/mouse. My iPad 7th Generation ( 2019 ) is perfect for this product. Second, setting up this Keyboard case was fairly easy, charge the Case first. Follow instructions that come with User Manual...not that complicated. I had a little difficulty getting the Bluetooth and my IPad connected, but that is mostly because I am not ultra tech savvy. Hey, just go to your IPad Settings/Control Panel and synchronize Ipad with Keyboard Case. While Flexbook is charging read User Manual, then go through setup instructions, this is relatively easy. There is a small switch on side of Case ( on/off ) this is for Bluetooth, just leave switch to on position. You can always go to YouTube and view a video on this as well. One extra nice detail about the Flexbook is the battery will hold up and you don’t have to constantly fixate on keeping unit charged up. After about a day or two, everything just clicked, I sat down at my desk and opened up my Flexbook and all technical issues fade-away. Now banking online and making purchases online is quick.

"It's the multifunctionality that really wins me over, and in such a small package. I've replaced my EDC bt speakers with these.

"I've been a serious amateur and occassional professional photographer for over 40 years. My experience spans the early SLR entries up to the present.<br /><br />I've also been a long-time Nikon groupie. In my opinion, they manufacture the best equipment of this type available, though in recent years the quality provided by a few of the tops seems to be closing the gap. By that I mean Canon specifically.<br /><br />That having been said, I'm the type of photographer that drags around a select few lenses and a couple of bodies so I can mix and match lenses and films.<br /><br />Speaking of which (films): I am not technology-averse. I love the idea of digital. I shoot home movies direct to DVD on Sony equipment. I also scan my 35MM negs/prints using the Canon 9950F (an excellent print scanner) or Nikon 5000ED Coolscan (the best slide/neg scanner)to digital files for further action in Photoshop.<br /><br />HOWEVER, that being said, I still shoot my stills in 35MM film.<br /><br />Several reasons:  Current digital camera bodies simply do not afford the flexibility in speed, sensitivity, or versatility that film does.<br /><br />I HATE the fact that the CMOS sensors effectively double the focal length of all my lenses (with currently only one exception, by Canon, I think).<br /><br />I'm recording my images to the only currently available archival medium: film. Yes, I know bytes and bits are supposedly archival. But 50 years from now, is your DVD still going to be readable by any then-current technology? Remember Beta? Or 8 track tapes?<br /><br />However, Daguerre's and Matthew Brady's prints<br /><br />(both from the 19th Century) still will be. As will mine -- and yours if you shoot in film.<br /><br />That having been said, a few years back, as I decided my eyes no longer afforded me the luxury of manual focus and I decided to go for the auto-focus capabilities now available, I stuck with Nikon and bought my first N-80.<br /><br />I am so happy I did! This camera is simply outstanding in every way, affording you the ability to use it as a simple point-and-shoot if you wish (due to its extremely fast and sharp system coupled with the Matrix Metering system, and on-board pop-up flash), as well as the option to take direct control over every aspect of the creative photo process with intuitive and easy-to-use systems.<br /><br />I liked it so much that a couple of years later I bought a second as a backup and system enhancer (meaning two loaded bodies with different lens/film combinations).<br /><br />An additional benefit is that as the current fad seems to be toward digital bodies, N-80 prices have gone down significantly.<br /><br />An interesting phenomenon that merits a quick observation: in order to get the same quality of resolution available with a good film/camera body/lens combination as far as cropping or enlargment capability goes, you have to spend in the neighborhood of $3000 to $4000 for a body-only camera, and you're STILL limited as to the duplication of film sensitivity. Try duplicating a 3000ASA film speed on a digital camera. Good luck! You'll be blasted by ""noise"" on the image; what we used to call ""grain"" for film, i.e. a loss of resolution and sharpness.<br /><br />I'm finally making the move up to my next big camera purchase. Guess what? It's a Nikon F-5. Another film body. What does that tell you?<br /><br />Buy this camera!

"This headset is very very good. Bass is really sounding as in theaters, Only listening to it on first out of two levels.<br />It can get loud, Surround is ehhh, I cant compare to other True surround headset since this is my first ever, though virtual surround headset that I used to have Icemat 7.1 Virtual Surround to which I still keep the USB adapter worked imho better. Or maybe not even. Thing Is when I try to play with the surround sound source positioning, its very hard to tell the sound comes from back or side drivers, fronts are somewhat faded and unified on both sides so theres obvious front position, perhaps distance of the front is further from the rear and sides which definitely gotta be really really close. Hard to tell but even to use it as a regular headset, the sound is very good. Bass is superb. I really like the power of it makes the eardrums shake even :P and! Playing horror games are more surreal than on the non-vibrating headset. It kinda thumps hard so for the price this is definitely a go with headset.<br />Now I had heard about people having static noise, it happened to me too, it got ridiculously loud HOWEVER, that is a software issue of a real time playback of the microphone, even unplugged. You need to mute the microphone playback !not the recording! and you should not hear weird static noises. Hope this helps if anyone experience the neverending strange sounds that are rather annoying to an extent you want to throw these excellent headphones in the garbage.<br />UPDATE: 2 Years Later, they still work as I remember from day 1. While there was an issue with win10, firstly not having drivers, rosewill did upgrade and made win10 compatible drivers probably within 3 months? Can tell the company keeps thinking of their products and mainly customers with older peripherals. There was temporary workaround but it was complicated and didnt work as official win10 driver.<br />As stated earlier though, the positioning is more like a guess, you can hear theres something running behind you, but its unclear and you may think its front. Vice versa. Though the sound is phenomenal with tweaking the EQ and setting the surround, clarity and other settings within the drivers software to this headset including microphone morphing called Magic Voice with 4 presets. Wish there were more though.<br />I just took one of the earcups out of curiosity if these are even true 5.1, yes they are. Its just shame that the drivers arent positioned differently and maybe in an elevated center plastic piece. I may try to mod them myself. And I spotted green and white wire just sitting there with no use. No, I didnt snap them out, theyre just there, one was dangerously exposing few strands of actual wire so I did trim then off, though Im guessing this couple of wires could be for additional driver, thus providing you an option for 7.2 surround sound. Not sure though.<br />Overall I'm satisfied with these as theyre good not only for games but music and movies as well and would highly recommend them for the price.<br />UPDATE: I see that theres entirely different product listed under the old product, majority of the reviews were applied to which may end up Misleading you in purchase of the new product reviewed thus misled as currently the new one certainly IS NOT Rosewill RHTS-8206, but RGH3300!!!",5.0,this headset is very very good bass is really sounding as in theaters only listening to it on first out of two levelsbr it can get loud surround is ehhh i cant compare to other true surround headset since this is my first ever though virtual surround headset that i used to have icemat virtual surround to which i still keep the usb adapter worked imho better or maybe not even thing is when i try to play with the surround sound source positioning its very hard to tell the sound comes from back or side drivers fronts are somewhat faded and unified on both sides so theres obvious front position perhaps distance of the front is further from the rear and sides which definitely gotta be really really close hard to tell but even to use it as a regular headset the sound is very good bass is superb i really like the power of it makes the eardrums shake even p and playing horror games are more surreal than on the nonvibrating headset it kinda thumps hard so for the price this is definitely a go with headsetbr now i had heard about people having static noise it happened to me too it got ridiculously loud however that is a software issue of a real time playback of the microphone even unplugged you need to mute the microphone playback not the recording and you should not hear weird static noises hope this helps if anyone experience the neverending strange sounds that are rather annoying to an extent you want to throw these excellent headphones in the garbagebr update years later they still work as i remember from day while there was an issue with win firstly not having drivers rosewill did upgrade and made win compatible drivers probably within months can tell the company keeps thinking of their products and mainly customers with older peripherals there was temporary workaround but it was complicated and didnt work as official win driverbr as stated earlier though the positioning is more like a guess you can hear theres something running behind you but its unclear and you may think its front vice versa though the sound is phenomenal with tweaking the eq and setting the surround clarity and other settings within the drivers software to this headset including microphone morphing called magic voice with presets wish there were more thoughbr i just took one of the earcups out of curiosity if these are even true yes they are its just shame that the drivers arent positioned differently and maybe in an elevated center plastic piece i may try to mod them myself and i spotted green and white wire just sitting there with no use no i didnt snap them out theyre just there one was dangerously exposing few strands of actual wire so i did trim then off though im guessing this couple of wires could be for additional driver thus providing you an option for surround sound not sure thoughbr overall im satisfied with these as theyre good not only for games but music and movies as well and would highly recommend them for the pricebr update i see that theres entirely different product listed under the old product majority of the reviews were applied to which may end up misleading you in purchase of the new product reviewed thus misled as currently the new one certainly is not rosewill rhts but rgh,3220

"Did you ever get one of those A/V components that made you want to go back and watch/listen too all of your movies/music again?  Well for me, these had me doing exactly that.  I got them 2 evenings ago and popped them on just for a minute to sample the sound before I burned them a bit.  Even without being burned in at all, I could tell these phones were going to be something special.  I set them up with an old iPod and fed them a mixture of white, pink, grey, and brown noise for about 14 hours.  After this initial burn, I ran them through a bass test regiment, feeding them bass waves from 5hz to 100hz in 5hz increments.  The results were impressive, the frequency response was as advertised, and no frequency produced any unwanted noise from the structure...these cans are solid.  It was time to listen to some music.  I connected the phones to my Nuforce Icon DAC / Acer C720 Chromebook and opened Google Play Music.  The Nuforce DAC is a wonderful digital-to-analog converter/headphone amp.  It has tons of power and doesn't color the sound at all.  It also works perfectly with the Chromebook when connected via USB.  The Google Play Music HTML 5 app doesn't have any EQ settings so I was not reducing or enhancing any frequencies, and all the files I played were ripped at 320kbps or higher.  I spent hours listening to different genres of music ranging from classical to thrash metal and everything in between, and I was really blown away by what I was hearing (and what I wasn't hearing).  The sound of these phones is very balanced with excellent highs, tight and accurate lows, and mids that sound incredibly natural.  The sound stage was impressive as well.  Not so narrow to make me feel like everything was happening inside my head, but not so wide that things started feeling distant or lost.  All the music played as though I had speakers with separate woofers, mid-ranges, and tweeters on my ears and no frequency range was drowning out the others.  I was listen to my music like I was a kid in a candy store; a little taste of this, a sample of that, and then grab one of these.  I spent hours and hours listening and I just didn't want to take them off.  These cans are worth every penny I spent on them.  I doubt I will every use my Sony MDR-V6s again, and I will likely only use my V-Moda Crossfade LP's when I really want to crank up the bass.  Are there better cans out there?  Yes.

No.  And believe me, I have tried a lot of them.",5.0,did you ever get one of those av components that made you want to go back and watchlisten too all of your moviesmusic again well for me these had me doing exactly that i got them evenings ago and popped them on just for a minute to sample the sound before i burned them a bit even without being burned in at all i could tell these phones were going to be something special i set them up with an old ipod and fed them a mixture of white pink grey and brown noise for about hours after this initial burn i ran them through a bass test regiment feeding them bass waves from hz to hz in hz increments the results were impressive the frequency response was as advertised and no frequency produced any unwanted noise from the structurethese cans are solid it was time to listen to some music i connected the phones to my nuforce icon dac acer c chromebook and opened google play music the nuforce dac is a wonderful digitaltoanalog converterheadphone amp it has tons of power and doesnt color the sound at all it also works perfectly with the chromebook when connected via usb the google play music html app doesnt have any eq settings so i was not reducing or enhancing any frequencies and all the files i played were ripped at kbps or higher i spent hours listening to different genres of music ranging from classical to thrash metal and everything in between and i was really blown away by what i was hearing and what i wasnt hearing the sound of these phones is very balanced with excellent highs tight and accurate lows and mids that sound incredibly natural the sound stage was impressive as well not so narrow to make me feel like everything was happening inside my head but not so wide that things started feeling distant or lost all the music played as though i had speakers with separate woofers midranges and tweeters on my ears and no frequency range was drowning out the others i was listen to my music like i was a kid in a candy store a little taste of this a sample of that and then grab one of these i spent hours and hours listening and i just didnt want to take them off these cans are worth every penny i spent on them i doubt i will every use my sony mdrvs again and i will likely only use my vmoda crossfade lps when i really want to crank up the bass are there better cans out there yes in this price range no and believe me i have tried a lot of them,2368

"How I use them:<br />Worship leader--I use them as in-ear monitors for rehearsals and on stage during live events.<br /><br />Frequency of use:<br />Generally twice per week, occasionally more if we have multiple events, occasionally less if I get a week off.<br /><br />My take:<br />I was honestly blown away by the sound quality at this price point. All the other five star reviews noting this are accurate. These are so impressive that they are the goto in-ears for any new member that comes on and needs a good pair fast. Some move on from them to more expensive brands, but more and more the members of our teams get these to start and then stick with them. I think mine is the first pair to suffer any kind of failure (but I was also the first to get them, so that makes sense).<br /><br />The only real con is that after about 9 or so months of twice-weekly-ish use, the wire in the cable on the right ear (for shaping around the ear) popped through. My best guess is it's a quality control issue, as opposed to me just being hard on them, only because I keep them in a hard case when not in use, and almost never use the right ear, keeping it out so I can better hear the room sound. Only once in a blue moon do I use the right ear and then only for a minute or so to get through a difficult part where I need to block room sound and be hyper focused to get something right. After it pierced through the cable sheathing, I gently removed it to keep it from snagging or poking or just tearing up the cable from the inside since it wasn't seated in place anymore. A few weeks later, the right ear didn't work at all anymore. Left side is unaffected. So at some point, I'll get another pair and see if it's just the cable that needs replacing or if the right monitor just went bad and it's unrelated to the cable, but for now I'm going to try out another model of KZs because they all have fantastic reviews and I want to see if I can find something even better for me.<br /><br />I do have relatively small ears, so these are a tad bulky, but all of them are for me. I'd need to get into the super pricey custom stuff to fix that, so these aren't faulted for that in my book. They're really great in-ears.<br /><br />All in all, still 5 stars because for twenty bucks I got more than 6 months worth of two hundred dollar quality. But do be aware that they probably won't last forever.",5.0,how i use thembr worship leaderi use them as inear monitors for rehearsals and on stage during live eventsbr br frequency of usebr generally twice per week occasionally more if we have multiple events occasionally less if i get a week offbr br my takebr i was honestly blown away by the sound quality at this price point all the other five star reviews noting this are accurate these are so impressive that they are the goto inears for any new member that comes on and needs a good pair fast some move on from them to more expensive brands but more and more the members of our teams get these to start and then stick with them i think mine is the first pair to suffer any kind of failure but i was also the first to get them so that makes sensebr br the only real con is that after about or so months of twiceweeklyish use the wire in the cable on the right ear for shaping around the ear popped through my best guess is its a quality control issue as opposed to me just being hard on them only because i keep them in a hard case when not in use and almost never use the right ear keeping it out so i can better hear the room sound only once in a blue moon do i use the right ear and then only for a minute or so to get through a difficult part where i need to block room sound and be hyper focused to get something right after it pierced through the cable sheathing i gently removed it to keep it from snagging or poking or just tearing up the cable from the inside since it wasnt seated in place anymore a few weeks later the right ear didnt work at all anymore left side is unaffected so at some point ill get another pair and see if its just the cable that needs replacing or if the right monitor just went bad and its unrelated to the cable but for now im going to try out another model of kzs because they all have fantastic reviews and i want to see if i can find something even better for mebr br i do have relatively small ears so these are a tad bulky but all of them are for me id need to get into the super pricey custom stuff to fix that so these arent faulted for that in my book theyre really great inearsbr br all in all still stars because for twenty bucks i got more than months worth of two hundred dollar quality but do be aware that they probably wont last forever,2285
"I love my docking station/hub for my M1 Mac Mini, but it’s bad to slide around.

"Before you read on you should know I’m 6’2” with really large hands. I needed this wood grip to help make this camera fit me. This is my story and why I feel that the smallrig cage with this wood grip is good for people with “large hands”.<br />  The Sony a6400 is an amazing camera with a small grip. I couldn’t justify not buying this camera just because of the small grip. So, I researched different solutions to make the camera fit my hands better, until I came across the smallrig 1889 cage. I immediately bought this cage without doing any research. It didn’t fit that good. My camera wiggled inside it and it just didn’t feel as secure as I thought it should feel.<br />  So I searched more and found the smallrig ccs2310 cage specifically designed for the Sony a6400. I seen that it mounted not only to the bottom tripod mount, but it had a second connection point that mounted through the right hole for the shoulder strap clasp. I bought this cage and never looked back!<br />  The cage alone helped with my large hands but I knew I needed to purchase the wood grip to have complete satisfaction. I thought the wood grip was a little over priced so I went without it for 2 months. The more time I spent without it, the more I was okay with it being over priced, so I eventually bought it.<br />  Now that I have it, I don’t think it’s overpriced at all. It feel really good in the hands and I no longer suffer from Hand cramps.<br />  If you’re thinking this smell piece of wood is overpriced and that’s the reason you’re not buying it, just trust me and make the purchase.

"I'm too lazy to buy a stand to put by my bed, and put a lamp within reaching distance of my bed. For that reason, I've never read in bed before. So, I was delighted at how easy this cover makes it to read in bed. I really, really like this cover for the [[ASIN:B002Y27P3M Kindle Keyboard]]. From what I can tell, Amazon does special offers on their Kindle covers every few months, and that's when I got mine. But, this cover would have been well worth full price, also.<br /><br />I'm the kind of person who usually never gets accessories. For example, I don't have a screen protector or a back protector on my cell phone, or any of my other electronic gadgets. So, I thought I'd just be using this for the light, but it's such a nice cover that I actually keep this on all the time.<br /><br />The light goes away seamlessly. Just pulling the light out turns it on, and pushing it back turns it off. It's bright enough to use as a backup emergency light if the power goes out. And the light doesn't drain the batteries very much. I haven't noticed a difference in charge either with or without this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this doesn't come for the next generation of Kindles, quite yet. Those Kindles have a cover, but from what I've read, it's not as nice.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Very professional looking<br />+Light is awesome!<br />+The strap is really cool. It either keeps it closed, or keeps it open<br />+The cover opens 360°, so you can wrap it behind the Kindle<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Adds a little bit of bulk to your Kindle<br />-Doesn't come for the next generation of Kindle<br />-A little light  goes out beyond the Kindle, so if you're in bed next to someone who needs absolute darkness, you'll need to buy them a darkness mask",5.0,im too lazy to buy a stand to put by my bed and put a lamp within reaching distance of my bed for that reason ive never read in bed before so i was delighted at how easy this cover makes it to read in bed i really really like this cover for the asinbypm kindle keyboard from what i can tell amazon does special offers on their kindle covers every few months and thats when i got mine but this cover would have been well worth full price alsobr br im the kind of person who usually never gets accessories for example i dont have a screen protector or a back protector on my cell phone or any of my other electronic gadgets so i thought id just be using this for the light but its such a nice cover that i actually keep this on all the timebr br the light goes away seamlessly just pulling the light out turns it on and pushing it back turns it off its bright enough to use as a backup emergency light if the power goes out and the light doesnt drain the batteries very much i havent noticed a difference in charge either with or without thisbr br unfortunately this doesnt come for the next generation of kindles quite yet those kindles have a cover but from what ive read its not as nicebr br prosbr very professional lookingbr light is awesomebr the strap is really cool it either keeps it closed or keeps it openbr the cover opens so you can wrap it behind the kindlebr br consbr adds a little bit of bulk to your kindlebr doesnt come for the next generation of kindlebr a little light goes out beyond the kindle so if youre in bed next to someone who needs absolute darkness youll need to buy them a darkness mask,1616
"I purchased this for two specific reasons: (1) safety because too many accidents are caused by drivers with a phone to their ear, and (2) I love music and my Droid X has become my MP3 player (among other things as well as a phone.<br /><br />Installation was a snap, although I did have to read the directions, which were clear and easy to follow. In less than 5 minutes after removing it from the packaging I was listening to music through my car radio!<br /><br />This device comes with a fairly short USB charging cable that connects to a port on the head. The length made it inconvenient, and it was pretty flimsy too, failing after about three months. I added a [[ASIN:B0042X8XQO PowerLine 90310 Auto Socket Splitter with USB Power Port]] (which cleared my console in my 2008 Mazda 3 with the GOgroove and [[ASIN:B000S5Q9CA Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger]] plugged in), and the combination, while unwieldy, has worked perfectly ever since.<br /><br />Music and calls are reasonably clear. I do have to turn my radio volume up when a call comes in, but that may be an issue with my phone and not the GOgroove. And, like a hands-free system should work, when there is an incoming call or you wish to make an outgoing one, the MP3 player feature in my Droid X pauses the music until I am finished using the phone. After calls are terminated any paused music will automatically resume.<br /><br />For long trips where you pass through areas with radio stations, your clear signal set in one location may start to degrade and you will notice static. That is caused by you coming into the range of a strong FM signal that is competing with the one you selected. You will need to seek and switch to a new frequency when that happens. For example, if I am traveling from, say, Ormond Beach, FL to Jacksonville, FL, I will need to change my frequency twice going up and twice again returning. It's the nature of any such device and there is nothing that can be designed into the GOgroove to fix it - at least not at the price point at which this device is selling.<br /><br />I've had friends connect to it with their iPhones, and it works without a hitch. The icing on the cake is the GOgroove remains paired with my Droid X, and automatically connects to it as soon as I start my car if I am playing music. This is a convenient feature that I wish my [[ASIN:B0047T79VS Belkin F8Z492TTP Bluetooth Music Receiver]] that is connected to my home stereo had - I have to manually connect to that device anytime I want to use it.<br /><br />Overall I am thrilled with my GOgroove and if it dies I would not hesitate to purchase another.

"These earbuds are great. First time connection is very easy, as they go into paring mode seamlessly and connected to my iPhone right away. I downloaded the app (Headphones Connect) which allows me to see the charge level on the earbuds themselves as well as the charge on the base. The app allows me to change settings for the noise cancellation, meaning you can turn the feature on and off, as well as an auto setting that it can learn what environments you prefer to have noise cancellation. I'm very happy with the noise cancellation feature, as it really does take about 80% (my estimation) of the background noise away from what I’m hearing from the outside world going on around me.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent for the price-point. The fit is perfect as well, and the variety of ear bud sizes helps ensure I got the best fit for me—they are comfortable to wear. The Alexa capability is an interesting feature, but I haven’t tinkered with it yet. I’ll be sure to update when I give that feature a try. Overall, I think these are worth the price and worth 5 stars!",5.0,these earbuds are great first time connection is very easy as they go into paring mode seamlessly and connected to my iphone right away i downloaded the app headphones connect which allows me to see the charge level on the earbuds themselves as well as the charge on the base the app allows me to change settings for the noise cancellation meaning you can turn the feature on and off as well as an auto setting that it can learn what environments you prefer to have noise cancellation im very happy with the noise cancellation feature as it really does take about my estimation of the background noise away from what im hearing from the outside world going on around mebr br the sound quality is excellent for the pricepoint the fit is perfect as well and the variety of ear bud sizes helps ensure i got the best fit for methey are comfortable to wear the alexa capability is an interesting feature but i havent tinkered with it yet ill be sure to update when i give that feature a try overall i think these are worth the price and worth stars,1043

"The HO artificial star resembles a small flashlight (takes 3 AAA batteries) with an off/on pushbutton switch and has a metal mask with 5 precision pinholes (50/100/150/200/250 microns) and an individual white LED aligned to each pinhole. You can select the appropriate size aperture for a particular telescope and distance placed from the selected artificial star.<br /><br />There is a magnetic mask that allows you to cover up to 4 of the 5 holes; you choose the one that works at your  distance and ambient light.  Hubble Optics' website lists 11 sites, and 1 book that give detailed instructions about how to use the artificial star.<br /><br />The only thing I might add to this would be a 1/4"" screw mount for a tripod, but this is light enough that you can just tape or rubber band this to a base.<br /><br />BTW, I truly don't understand the negative reviews.

"I really like this Kindle cover. I've got a several of the e-ink Kindles (K3, Kindle Touch, and a Kindle basic).

"As of this review this retro radio only costs $19.99 which I think is a very fair price for it.  It's not made to be used in harsh situations because the plastic casing will definitely get crack the first time it's dropped.  The big dial rotates smoothly and using the attached antennae it picks up a lot of radio stations.  It has a good sound too.  It comes with a power supply but will also take 4 AA batteries.  I'm not sure yet where I want to use this radio.  I will have to think of the environment it will be in because it's kind of fragile.  It's very cool looking and definitely retro, but fragile nonetheless.  It looks exactly as pictured on the product page.",5.0,as of this review this retro radio only costs which i think is a very fair price for it its not made to be used in harsh situations because the plastic casing will definitely get crack the first time its dropped the big dial rotates smoothly and using the attached antennae it picks up a lot of radio stations it has a good sound too it comes with a power supply but will also take aa batteries im not sure yet where i want to use this radio i will have to think of the environment it will be in because its kind of fragile its very cool looking and definitely retro but fragile nonetheless it looks exactly as pictured on the product page,639
"This camera is a great camera for the money. It offers affordability, function, and great shots at a wonderful price point. For a bit more than a full featured point-and-shoot, you can get an equally full featured DSLR.<br /><br />This camera offers ease of use for beginners to the SLR market but also has a full feature set that even experienced photogs would love to have.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into all the features here, you can read them above on Amazon's product page, but I will tell you that they are there to help you get the most of your shot. You can, of course, control exposure, shutter, and aperture, but you can also control white balance and color modes with a push of a button.<br /><br />At high ISO speeds you can shoot indoors without a flash, your pictures will turn out beautiful and perfect every time.  What once you would need a 80a or a neutral density filter for you can now do with a few brief menu options on the camera.<br /><br />Another great feature is the live view feature where you can use the LCD screen to see what the camera sees. This is so you won't have to look through the viewfinder and especially useful when doing tripod work.<br /><br />Also the EF-S mount on this camera will also accept your older EF lenses, though EF-S lenses won't fit on your EF mount camera.<br /><br />Overall this is a great camera. It offers wonderful features, price, and takes great pictures.  So why don't you move up to a DSLR and start taking great pictures instead of just good pictures.",5.0,this camera is a great camera for the money it offers affordability function and great shots at a wonderful price point for a bit more than a full featured pointandshoot you can get an equally full featured dslrbr br this camera offers ease of use for beginners to the slr market but also has a full feature set that even experienced photogs would love to havebr br im not going to get into all the features here you can read them above on amazons product page but i will tell you that they are there to help you get the most of your shot you can of course control exposure shutter and aperture but you can also control white balance and color modes with a push of a buttonbr br at high iso speeds you can shoot indoors without a flash your pictures will turn out beautiful and perfect every time what once you would need a a or a neutral density filter for you can now do with a few brief menu options on the camerabr br another great feature is the live view feature where you can use the lcd screen to see what the camera sees this is so you wont have to look through the viewfinder and especially useful when doing tripod workbr br also the efs mount on this camera will also accept your older ef lenses though efs lenses wont fit on your ef mount camerabr br overall this is a great camera it offers wonderful features price and takes great pictures so why dont you move up to a dslr and start taking great pictures instead of just good pictures,1450

"I've had this camera for several months after trying two others from different manufacturers, both costing more than the MiVue 538.

I blank mine after ten seconds, but the LED indicators continue to blink when recording, so you are assured that the unit is still operating. The camera hasn't gone through the acid test of our South Carolina summer yet, so we'll have to see how it does.

"This cable bears the MFi (Made for iPod/iPad/iPhone) logo on the packaging and looks nearly identical to the real thing. The only things different are there is no Apple logo on the cable and it does not carry the Apple price tag.<br /><br />I tested it both as a charging cable and a synching cable with an iPad 2 and it performed flawlessly.<br /><br />The thing that is the same is this is manufactured to Apple's specs and did earn the MFI certification. Why this is important to me is most third party manufacturers have dropped this legacy cable and are now licensing Apple's Lightning cable (if they are even MFi certified). Decent 30 pin cables are becoming scarce, and the ones from Apple are pricy. That leaves a lot of fly-by-night cables that have a high failure rate, and I am frankly tiring of replacing cables on a monthly basis (I had been purchasing them from a well known big box store as well as a nationwide electronics chain.)

"Pros:<br />The greatest positive attribute of this case is that it holds the Apple Pencil neatly and securely tucked inside the molded plastic portion of the case (vs in a flimsy, elastic loop offered by other models) and it also has a place for the pencil cap and for charging coupler when either are not in use.<br /><br />The grooves built into the cover to hold the iPad up for viewing are well made (deep enough that it doesn’t slip out easily), but the case would be greatly improved by adding a 3rd groove closer to the spine in order for the iPad to sit in a more upright position when in landscape mode.<br /><br />Cons:<br />This is my second case of the same style from the same company (different color way).

"This is a decent PC monitor that doesn’t excel in any area but, at the same time, doesn’t fall flat either (except for sound quality). It’s a good choice if you’re looking for an inexpensive, wide-screen monitor that comes in at under $100.<br /><br />The build quality is what you’d expect at this price point: pretty basic and simple. The casing is all plastic, and rather cheap feeling plastic at that. It comes with a very basic stand that allows a limited amount of tilt adjustment, but no swivel or monitor rotation. There are no mounting holes on the back to facilitate a wall or stand mount. There are also no convenience features, such as a USB hub. It also lacks an HDMI port.<br /><br />On the plus side, the power cord just plugs into the monitor without the need for a transformer or wall wart. The overall monitor profile is pretty slim, and it is very lightweight.<br /><br />Setup is very simple. No tools are needed to attach the stand (just push and it clicks into place). It comes with a VGA cable, a 3.5mm audio cable and a power cable. Although it includes a DVI port, it does not come with the cable to use that. It also does not come with a user guide (other than a one-page quick setup sheet) or a driver disk. Both are available as downloads from the HP site. However, neither are really needed.<br /><br />I hooked it up to my laptop via VGA to use as a secondary monitor. It auto installed under Win 7, so it should be able to do the same for 8 and 10. The recommended resolution is 1600x900 at 60Htz.<br /><br />Right out of the box the settings were eye-searing bright, as is typical with manufacturer defaults since they want their monitors to stand out when on display in a store. Changing the settings is pretty easy – the menu button brings up the full list of options; you select the one you want; then adjust with the +/- keys. You can experiment at will since there’s also a choice to return to factory defaults should you get lost in the weeds with changes. The adjustment menu is pretty extensive for a monitor at this price point. You can adjust the usual brightness and contrast, and also color temp, image control, and even turn off the blue LED power indicator (yes!). Unfortunately, the control button labels are impossible to read (black on black) but there’s only a few buttons, so it's not tough to figure out.<br /><br />The image quality is decent once it’s been properly adjusted. It won’t wow you, but it provides good performance on both images and text. I was happier with the text performance than I was with video (it has pretty limited black levels) but, for an everyday, inexpensive monitor, it’s more than acceptable.<br /><br />The speakers are very, very basic. Tinny to the point of being useless. I’ve gotten better sound out of a $5 set of basic computer speakers.<br /><br />I’m giving this 4 stars since, even at this price point, HP could have done a better job with the overall look/feel of the monitor, have included some additional convenience features such as a swivel, USB hub, and/or an HDMI port. Features that could have been dropped are the internal speakers, which are useless for anything other than to hear system beeps. Still, even as-is, it’s worth considering if you’re looking for a no-frills, no-fuss, inexpensive monitor.",4.0,this is a decent pc monitor that doesnt excel in any area but at the same time doesnt fall flat either except for sound quality its a good choice if youre looking for an inexpensive widescreen monitor that comes in at under br br the build quality is what youd expect at this price point pretty basic and simple the casing is all plastic and rather cheap feeling plastic at that it comes with a very basic stand that allows a limited amount of tilt adjustment but no swivel or monitor rotation there are no mounting holes on the back to facilitate a wall or stand mount there are also no convenience features such as a usb hub it also lacks an hdmi portbr br on the plus side the power cord just plugs into the monitor without the need for a transformer or wall wart the overall monitor profile is pretty slim and it is very lightweightbr br setup is very simple no tools are needed to attach the stand just push and it clicks into place it comes with a vga cable a mm audio cable and a power cable although it includes a dvi port it does not come with the cable to use that it also does not come with a user guide other than a onepage quick setup sheet or a driver disk both are available as downloads from the hp site however neither are really neededbr br i hooked it up to my laptop via vga to use as a secondary monitor it auto installed under win so it should be able to do the same for and the recommended resolution is x at htzbr br right out of the box the settings were eyesearing bright as is typical with manufacturer defaults since they want their monitors to stand out when on display in a store changing the settings is pretty easy the menu button brings up the full list of options you select the one you want then adjust with the keys you can experiment at will since theres also a choice to return to factory defaults should you get lost in the weeds with changes the adjustment menu is pretty extensive for a monitor at this price point you can adjust the usual brightness and contrast and also color temp image control and even turn off the blue led power indicator yes unfortunately the control button labels are impossible to read black on black but theres only a few buttons so its not tough to figure outbr br the image quality is decent once its been properly adjusted it wont wow you but it provides good performance on both images and text i was happier with the text performance than i was with video it has pretty limited black levels but for an everyday inexpensive monitor its more than acceptablebr br the speakers are very very basic tinny to the point of being useless ive gotten better sound out of a set of basic computer speakersbr br im giving this stars since even at this price point hp could have done a better job with the overall lookfeel of the monitor have included some additional convenience features such as a swivel usb hub andor an hdmi port features that could have been dropped are the internal speakers which are useless for anything other than to hear system beeps still even asis its worth considering if youre looking for a nofrills nofuss inexpensive monitor,3115

"These two aluminum light stands came in fabric (nylon?) carry cases that zip up and have an adjustable carry strap. With the stand inside, the case was 29&quot; long by 3&quot; wide. No instructions were included, and I've never used light stands before so I may not have done it correctly. However, the height of the light stand at the greatest extension was 6' 11&quot; and the base was about 23&quot; across with the length between legs at 25&quot;. At the lower heights, the stand seemed stable enough, but I'm not sure it would be if the light was big and the stand fully extended. The legs were easy to extend out to the extension shown in most of the pictures, but they became more difficult to open after that point. The two latches were a bit stiff to work, but they did effectively hold the extended length in place when closed (though this was done without lights attached, FYI).",4.0,these two aluminum light stands came in fabric nylon carry cases that zip up and have an adjustable carry strap with the stand inside the case was quot long by quot wide no instructions were included and ive never used light stands before so i may not have done it correctly however the height of the light stand at the greatest extension was quot and the base was about quot across with the length between legs at quot at the lower heights the stand seemed stable enough but im not sure it would be if the light was big and the stand fully extended the legs were easy to extend out to the extension shown in most of the pictures but they became more difficult to open after that point the two latches were a bit stiff to work but they did effectively hold the extended length in place when closed though this was done without lights attached fyi,846

"At home I use headphones like the Sennhesier HD600 and HiFiMan HE-400 and HE-500 which are audiophile grade along with all the IEM's I used to have.  I wanted a pair of good headphones I could wear when I'm out and about so I looked around.  I was going to get some thing like the Sennheiser HD-25 or something along those lines but wanted something that looked a bit better though I normally don't care as long as they sound good.  I've heard the Beats HP's and they suck as far as SQ but I've read some good reviews about the SL150's by Soul so I took a chance.<br /><br />Build quality wise they're fine and seem built just as good as Beats and others plus they fold down for easy use when traveling.  Now the SQ isn't bad, isn't bad at all.  The bass is very full with good depth but theses more mid-bass but it still sounds clean.  The mids have good detail but not great as well as the treble which is laid back and that I like.  Soundstage is average for a pair of HP's while imaging was good but the separation wasn't great and with complex songs it tends to sound a bit cluttered, though I was expecting that after some reviews from quality sources have said.<br /><br />Over all these are a nice stylish pair of HP's with good SQ and for around $80 to $85 new I think its a pretty good deal.

"I own a Tecsun PL-600 and PL-660 for comparison purposes. Bottom line up front: The Executive Elite is a solid, middle of the road HF portable in my opinion.<br /><br />Build quality: Average to above average. Solid case, but cheap feeling plastic. The buttons have a good feel to them, however, I wish they were backlit. The radio comes with a nice leather case that functions well.<br /><br />Display quality and layout: Above average. The orange on black look is a love or hate thing for a lot of people. I happen like it. It works well in sunlight too. The layout of the letters and numbers is also good, with everything being easy to read. No major complaints.<br /><br />Radio performance: MW = Above average, SW = Above average. Both MW and SW perform well when compared to my Tecsun PL-600 and PL-660. Sensitivity of the executive is on par with the Tecsuns, and Tecsun receivers are generally regarded as being the cream of the crop when it comes to sensitivity among portable radios. My only complaints are that weaker SSB broadcasts tend to come in with very low audio, and that the sync detection is practically useless in most cases. A workaround to the low audio on SSB is to use noise cancelling or noise isolating headphones. I use my Bose QC15's when tuning around on SW/SSB, and they make the listening experience much nicer.<br /><br />Tuning: Marginal to poor. This is, without question, the Elite Executive's biggest weakness. The tuning wheel has significant indents when turning, and there is noticeable muting between frequency changes, making the tuning experience quite frustrating. It's not as bad when the tuning mode is set to fast, and you are browsing the broadcast bands at 5khz increments, but when tuning SSB in slow mode, forget it... It's a tedious process, and to top it off, there is loud pop with each frequency change. When you are wearing headphones, that popping noise becomes even more noticeable, and makes the listening experience rather fatiguing. Compare this to the Tecsun radios, which, IMO, have the best tuners in class.<br /><br />Likes and dislikes:<br />Likes -- Radio has a nice size, display is easy to read, good selectivity, good sensitivity, good performance all around, takes regular AA batteries!<br />Dislikes -- Tuning around the bands is tedious, loud pops when tuning in SSB mode, dust collects easily under the top display piece<br /><br />Worth the purchase?: This is one of the better portable radios with SSB on the market.

"I tried the Ubiquiti LR AP based on the sheer number of positive reviews, however it kept losing its connection with the router and reporting &#34;missing heartbeat&#34; errors.  What a cryptic and creepy error.  I didn't realize I was an ER doctor.  Anyway, t tried multiple configurations and even tried using a different router to no avail.  I was about to throw my hands up and then decided to give this a try as a last resort. I was dealing with boosting signal in a home with solid brick walls throughout. It's amazing how this much brick kills your signal.  Anyway, my goal was to get it to rebroadcast signal to the cottage on the property, which is about 30 ft away, as well as in the library of the main house.  I positioned the repeater in a window of the main house, in a way that sneaks through hallways to improve signal throughout the home as well as to the cottage. Previously the cottage was getting .5 download and .25 upload when lucky.  Now we're getting 15 down and 5-6 up.  Enough to stream Netflix.  Yes, a repeater broadcasts a degraded signal, but if you are rebroadcasting a decent signal with a decent speed, all will work well. Try repositioning it until you get the best signal.  Alas, the wifi analyzer tool only works on Android and PC, which is a big bummer for Apple users.  I couldn't get it to work on Win 8, however.  It wouldn't detect networks, so instead I used speedtest to keep checking the speeds to find the ideal placement of the repeater. 4 stars because of the lack of Mac compatibility with WiFi analyzer. The footprint is small, which is great. Fear not, it's powerful antennas will eliminate dead spots.

"I've wanted a pair of bluetoothin ear headphones for a long time.  I have a wired pair that function on bluetooth but they are connected by a wire and hang around your neck, so I was really excited to get my hands on these.<br /><br />First off, the charging case is really nice looking and feels good in your hand, it's a nice weight and it opens and closes very well.  The earbuds will only go in the case one way and the magnet that holds them in is strong and keeps them connected to the case for charging.<br /><br />They charge REALLY quickly both with the battery from the case and when the case is plugged into the wall, and the battery life on the earbuds is REALLY good.  I charged them several times out of the case since I got them and it is still juicing them back up after watching netflix on my ipad for a couple hours a night.<br /><br />They pair really easy and quickly and they sync properly when only using one earbud or when using both of them.  There is no noticeable delay between video and the sound either which is great!<br /><br />Overall these are really nice wireless earbuds. My only issues are that while the right earbud fits very well in my ear, I can't seem to get the left to fit well no matter which rubber fitment cap I use so I'm constantly adjusting that earbud.

"This is a decent television at this price point. It works well for me in my office. I like the roku layout as it makes it very simple to decide which app/input you want to watch. My only complaint with this product is that it is a bit slow to respond at times and it is easy to hit the larger buttons for netflix, hulu, etc. At least one of those buttons is no longer relevant either - it says the app is no longer available. Overall though, I am satisfied with my purchase and it fits my needs.

"The camera is great during the day and at night. I like being able to remotely point it more than I thought I would, and setup was super easy.<br /><br />The app is a buggy mess though. The app’s feedback form is totally busted, which is why I’m writing this review. As you can see in the attached photo, on iphone se the menu in the app is cut off so you can’t view 5 minute clips, only 30 minute clips. You also can’t fast forward through video. That makes it very hard to scan through recorded video for when motion detection doesn’t cut it, as for my case. There’s also basic design issues making everything much harder to do than it should be.<br /><br />The poor app quality is a shame as I love the camera.

"(* im giving this 5 but i think the price on all of these is a little outrageous, i think they are worth about half the asking price. Many similar products are relatively overpriced so at least it is not alone in that sense. That being said the actual product is 5 stars, the price is like 2 or 3 in my opinion)<br />Picked this up at a seasonal brookstone store in the local mall. it was a floor display so i got it 1/2 off, 35$ish.  I bought it to use with an acer iconia one 7 tablet. i was pritty sure it would work fine and it does. i cant use the shell that came with it since its made for the ipad but that's hardly relevant. I also did quite a bit of research on the potential of magnetic cases causing damage and as far as i can tell it wont, and after the few days ive had it, it hasnt. i already have a folding leather case for my tablet so ive been using both that and this, closing them on each other for travel, works fine when folded up like that, i stick a rubber band around them and 'voila'. The point is its versatile.<br />~It seems sturdy enough and by itself is rather light and not bulky. The keyboard stays in the case nicely and can be removed easily.<br />~To pair it is simple, press function and delete while your tablet is searching.<br />~the 'cover' folds in an origami style and supports a tablet, or phone, in landscape or portrait<br />~works with my acer tablet as well as my samsung galaxy 4 (both running android)<br />~case looks sharp<br />~keys feel good and my fingers are getting used to the compact design<br /><br />****this is a follow up to my review above*******<br />UPDATE: the magnetic field CAN effect the operation of a capacitive touch screen. I discovered the issue after i had the tablet in close proximity with the magnetic case, on and off for days. The screen was not reponding correctly to a stylus. The stylus was leaving 'gaps' in lines. even when it was not near the magnetic case. i reset the tablet, cleaned the screen nothing worked until i removed it from its own leather case, who has two 4 magnets of its own. After that it was fine, i put it back in the leather case and it still funtions fine.<br />I believe that the keyboard case magnests somehow interacted with the leather case magnets and the device, establishing enouph of an electromagnetic field to disrupt the touch screen sensors. it is my thought that once the keyboard case was removed the field never actually diminished until i took even the smaller magnets of the leather case away for a moment, even though the leather case had never provided a problem on its own.",4.0,im giving this but i think the price on all of these is a little outrageous i think they are worth about half the asking price many similar products are relatively overpriced so at least it is not alone in that sense that being said the actual product is stars the price is like or in my opinionbr picked this up at a seasonal brookstone store in the local mall it was a floor display so i got it off ish i bought it to use with an acer iconia one tablet i was pritty sure it would work fine and it does i cant use the shell that came with it since its made for the ipad but thats hardly relevant i also did quite a bit of research on the potential of magnetic cases causing damage and as far as i can tell it wont and after the few days ive had it it hasnt i already have a folding leather case for my tablet so ive been using both that and this closing them on each other for travel works fine when folded up like that i stick a rubber band around them and voila the point is its versatilebr it seems sturdy enough and by itself is rather light and not bulky the keyboard stays in the case nicely and can be removed easilybr to pair it is simple press function and delete while your tablet is searchingbr the cover folds in an origami style and supports a tablet or phone in landscape or portraitbr works with my acer tablet as well as my samsung galaxy both running androidbr case looks sharpbr keys feel good and my fingers are getting used to the compact designbr br this is a follow up to my review abovebr update the magnetic field can effect the operation of a capacitive touch screen i discovered the issue after i had the tablet in close proximity with the magnetic case on and off for days the screen was not reponding correctly to a stylus the stylus was leaving gaps in lines even when it was not near the magnetic case i reset the tablet cleaned the screen nothing worked until i removed it from its own leather case who has two magnets of its own after that it was fine i put it back in the leather case and it still funtions finebr i believe that the keyboard case magnests somehow interacted with the leather case magnets and the device establishing enouph of an electromagnetic field to disrupt the touch screen sensors it is my thought that once the keyboard case was removed the field never actually diminished until i took even the smaller magnets of the leather case away for a moment even though the leather case had never provided a problem on its own,2475

"Now, for those who have read previous laptop reviews by me, I am very particular.  Those that get in the 4-5 range are those that meet all the criteria for a very well rounded computer at competitive pricing.  This happens to be one of the few laptops that would be worth considering!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- 15.4"" TFT Screen - 1280x800... not too shabby.  The widescreen aspect makes this a pleasure to view movies as well as every day tasks.<br /><br />- Core Duo - So much better than the Pentium M in terms of performance.  Everything runs much faster!<br /><br />- 2 GB of RAM!!!!!! - You don't see that often in an 1,100 computer, especially one as well equiped as this.<br /><br />- Battery - Average.  I got 2.2 (132 minutes) hours with WiFi (Bluetooth off) on and doing multiple tasks including installing FireFox, Maya, Photoshop and World of WarCraft, and over 3 hours with WiFi off and doing productivity tasks, listening to music.<br /><br />- Graphics Card - Makes this not only Vista Compatible, but also capable of 3D games.  WoW runs without a hitch!<br /><br />- Bluetooth<br /><br />- Integrated camera - 1.3 MegaPixel and rotates 225 degrees<br /><br />- 120GB SATA Hard Drive - THAT'S HUGE for a laptop with a single hard drive<br /><br />- DVD+/-RW DL! - Super Multi-Drive indeed, burns pretty much anything mainstream.  I have not tested the speed of this, but with the specs, I would assume encoding isn't TOO much of a chore like in some of the slower Pentiums.<br /><br />- Tons of ports - Firewire, Infrared, S-Video, DVI-Out, 4 USB Ports!, etc.<br /><br />- XP Pro - no complaint there<br /><br />- 80% One Hour Charge - Great<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- A little heavy<br /><br />- Some competition has better battery life<br /><br />- Although Core Duo, 1.66GHz is the slowest in the line (2.33GHz is the current fastest)<br /><br />- Not the best looking Notebook<br /><br />- Tends to get really warm<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: ALthough not the most powerful notebook on the market, the best in this price range.

"this product works as intended and provides good flexibility in terms of power adapters.<br /><br />The following are the things which keep me from giving it 5 stars:<br />1) it is bulky.  The charging block is quite big.  The power cable that connects to the wall outlet needs to be packed separately or, if you leave it connected, will make it even more bulky when packing it up.  Would love to see some way where it can be easily bundled up into a compact form factor.<br />2) It is not silent.  There seems to be an active fan component to this power converter and it has a high pitched whine to it.  It's not super loud but it is loud enough where you will notice it in a quiet room.  This can be annoying for some people.

"This tablet comes with everything listed in their description, and is rather nice looking. The camera quality is very poor, but then, on lower priced tablets, that is usually the case. The setup was rather simple, but there was a stickiness to the screen that messed with the touch screen. I do not know if this was from the protective film that covered the whole tablet, but was easily resolved with some cleaner. My only issue with this tablet, is that most streaming apps I can not even find in Google play store. They are not compatible with the device. So if you are getting this for streaming, I would definitely seek out other tablets. Netflix, Disney, Hulu, and a few others could not be added to this. Now, having said that, it downloads just about any game I tried to download, and in the event that it did not, there were still a ton of games that I could. The battery seems to last quite a while, and the picture quality is pretty clear. Volume is decent as well.  The case sits too closely to the screen, and it makes it difficult to use the slide down screens, but, if you are getting this for a child, it makes it harder for them to accidentally mess with the settings, so this is sort of a plus. Overall, this is a decent tablet, and will work just fine for small kids.",4.0,this tablet comes with everything listed in their description and is rather nice looking the camera quality is very poor but then on lower priced tablets that is usually the case the setup was rather simple but there was a stickiness to the screen that messed with the touch screen i do not know if this was from the protective film that covered the whole tablet but was easily resolved with some cleaner my only issue with this tablet is that most streaming apps i can not even find in google play store they are not compatible with the device so if you are getting this for streaming i would definitely seek out other tablets netflix disney hulu and a few others could not be added to this now having said that it downloads just about any game i tried to download and in the event that it did not there were still a ton of games that i could the battery seems to last quite a while and the picture quality is pretty clear volume is decent as well the case sits too closely to the screen and it makes it difficult to use the slide down screens but if you are getting this for a child it makes it harder for them to accidentally mess with the settings so this is sort of a plus overall this is a decent tablet and will work just fine for small kids,1248

"These Jabra Elite Active 45e Wireless Sports Earbuds are comfortable enough to wear and definitely stay put however I can't get them to make a seal in my ears and there are no other tips included. Pairing was super easy which I would expect from a Jabra product. Sound quality is decent for this type of earbud but without being able to seat them snugly in the ear canal, they really do lack in bass. In a quiet room the call quality works great as I had no issues hearing the caller and the caller could hear me clearly. I do like the physical volume control and it is easy to adjust. I did notice some issues with the music dropping out on occasion while walking throughout the house but it was not much different than other wireless buds that I own.

"I put off installing this router because I was trying to get the codes from our ISP, and they are so terrible they never return calls. We've had seriously degraded, sporadically available internet service and have decided to switch providers. (We live on a mountain, facing north, with the mountain behind us, in a small town, so we don't have a lot of options for service. Our current setup involves bouncing off one satellite dish to another, and it doesn't work very well.)<br /><br />Because I figured I couldn't screw up much of anything by trying to install the router using the default codes, I tried that. Setup was simple enough, and it seems to be working a little bit better than the other router we were using (provided by the ISP), but the overall quality of service (not the router's fault) is still bad enough that we ordered through a phone line-based service. (They are shipping a wireless modem to us, so I don't think we'll need this router when it comes. The computer geek of the house says we won't, anyway.)<br /><br />What all of this tells me is that the router is easy to set up and could improve reception. It's got a tidy form factor and simple, easy-to-understand indicator lights. I cannot address the more cutting-edge features of this router (AC) because it's not available to us, but this seems to be a good value for a router if you want to break into AC.

My only complaint is it has a lot bounce if your planning to type on this, and the mouse clicks make it even worse..HOWEVER!! I did find the source of the bounce and it's not the arm itself. It's the laptop tray. Because of how it's design the trey itself naturally flexes from the bent joint (i've circled it in red). As a test I put an object (aka my wall charger lol) as support (also in the picture) and it reduced the bounce by waay more than 50%!!! I'll probably cut a piece of wood to size and add it as support. Great thing is you can leave it in there!<br /><br />Don't think twice - buy it, you won't be disappointed.

"I've followed the evolution of Roku's products for a while and recently decided to ""make the plunge"". I researched the popular competitors -- Apple TV, WD, Logitech/Google and decided on Roku although this ""internet - TV"" market is still young and rapidly changing. Back in December, I loaded the Netflix applet on our Wii and signed up for a 30 day trial. I was amazed at the overall quality of the streaming video feed, even at the low 480i resolution. That experience led me to the Roku to see what the higher 720p resolution would look like on our Sony HDTV. Definitely improved but not as much as I'd hoped.<br /><br />From a setup view, the Roku is easy and quick. Doing a bit of preliminary internet research on setting up private channels helped a lot although I'm not impressed with the Roku's channel presentation format -- very basic. Also, the channel content is very limited in quantity and quality, but that's the case for this overall market currently. Very much an ""early adopter"" phase and rapidly changing. I have not yet tested the XD/S's dual-channel wireless ability since I only have a single channel router using 802.11g. However, the wireless communication is more than adequate for video streaming in spite of my router being upstairs and opposite end of house from my HDTV (at least 70 ft and several walls away).<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with Roku XD/S performance and ease of use although I realistically believe that most users would be happy with either of the lower cost Roku products too.",4.0,ive followed the evolution of rokus products for a while and recently decided to make the plunge i researched the popular competitors apple tv wd logitechgoogle and decided on roku although this internet tv market is still young and rapidly changing back in december i loaded the netflix applet on our wii and signed up for a day trial i was amazed at the overall quality of the streaming video feed even at the low i resolution that experience led me to the roku to see what the higher p resolution would look like on our sony hdtv definitely improved but not as much as id hopedbr br from a setup view the roku is easy and quick doing a bit of preliminary internet research on setting up private channels helped a lot although im not impressed with the rokus channel presentation format very basic also the channel content is very limited in quantity and quality but thats the case for this overall market currently very much an early adopter phase and rapidly changing i have not yet tested the xdss dualchannel wireless ability since i only have a single channel router using g however the wireless communication is more than adequate for video streaming in spite of my router being upstairs and opposite end of house from my hdtv at least ft and several walls awaybr br overall im satisfied with roku xds performance and ease of use although i realistically believe that most users would be happy with either of the lower cost roku products too,1449

"I ordered the 'Divoom Pro Premium 40W 12Hour Playtime TWS Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Water Resistant for Indoor/Outdoor Use(Black)' for review.<br /><br />I am a sucker for portable Bluetooth speakers and I had to give this one a go and I must say that I was not disappointed (well maybe just a little - continue reading .....). My first impression when opening the box was that this thing is heavy for how small it is. The speaker itself is a nice size with a beautiful basic design. The controls are really simple and feel very tactile. They are easy to feel which button you are pressing. The speaker comes with really nice braided type cables. One for charging and one Aux cable. Both are quite short however which really isn't a big deal. Especially for the fact that once you fully charge this beast, it'll give you a ""claimed"" 12 hour play time. I have not pushed this limit yet as I have only used it for a couple hours at a time but I have not recharged it yet. Although this speaker has a water resistant rating of IPX5, I have not tested this, but from how this is built, I would feel confident that I could take it outside and not worry about a little Oregon rain or being splashed on by the kids playing in the sprinklers. The really cool thing about this speaker is that you can charge your device while listening to it via the USB type A port.<br /><br />There are only a couple of cons with this speaker in my opinion. First con - Where is the USB C charging? I always have to point this out with new products. This charges via Micro USB.  USB C should be integrated and standard in all new products in my opinion. Second con is that when watching videos there are sync issues. So if you are planning to use this for watching anything video streaming, it gets pretty annoying. This is a new product, and I would think that both USB C and Bluetooth 5.0 should be a standard these days. With that said my overall impression with this Divoom speaker, is that for listening to music it's a beast. It pairs up easily with not much of a delay at all once it has been initially paired to your device. Turn the power on and it'll pair back up fast and ready to play. I also like the fact that if you have two of these (I wish I did) they can sync together to produce a much fuller stereo experience. Maybe down the road I will get a second one and update this review with how well that feature works.

"I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire (8"") when I'm reading in bed in the travel trailer.  I've currently attached it to a shelf in a bookshelf: attaches just fine and is very secure.  I removed the Kindle from it's holder and put it into the clamp: again, attached just fine and appears very secure.  However, when I go to tap on the Kindle, the whole unit wobbles.  Due to the design, this is expected so I may still have to hold the unit when playing games or searching the web.  The main pole that goes to the back of the holder is very strong: had to strong-arm it into position but the end that attaches to the clamp for the shelf is a plastic 'screw' for adjusting the holding clamp and the pole moves within that unit.  I'm going to try sticking some foam into that area as that should adjust the wobble.  Just be aware: might need a bit of modification to keep your unit (like my Kindle) still.

"At the time I received this remote with my new X1 box, it was the first ""smart"" remote we had in the household; I was fiddling with the remote, box, and TV for a whole night to soak in all the features. My favorite to this day is how intelligent the lighting is on the buttons; lift them slightly and the lights turn on, but remain off when lying still for a while.<br /><br />I haven't used the voice features after the initial night, so I can't comment on that. Everything still works great, and overall I find the button configuration pretty intuitive. I still confuse the Exit and Last buttons sometimes, so maybe some tweaking could be used between those two (if there hasn't been yet). But the main issue I have is how the power buttons don't work properly. When turning on both box and TV, the TV will turn on but the X1 box won't. It's been like that with two TVs.

I forgot my card reader on a trip and Amazon had it shipped to General Delivery and saved me a lot of grief. It works perfectly for transferring my digital photos onto my laptop for editing.

I love this Kindle so far! I have had a Kindle Keyboard(Gen 3) for years and was always skeptical to upgrade because I really liked having the page-turning buttons. Sadly my old one broke just a few days ago :( and I decided to upgrade using Amazon’s trade-in program. The lack of buttons hasn’t been as issue since the page turns based off of which side you touch. Some reviews stated issues with the location of the power button causing it to turn off when holding it with the right hand and I did experience that same issue…. until putting it into the leather case; I have been using it for the past several hours and have had no further issues with the location of the power button. The brightness and warmth adjustment make the screen very easy on the eyes regardless of the ambient light around you. My only complaint is that it is pretty heavy in the case compared to my old model and may cause issues with prolonged use since I have very small hands.,4.0,i love this kindle so far i have had a kindle keyboardgen for years and was always skeptical to upgrade because i really liked having the pageturning buttons sadly my old one broke just a few days ago and i decided to upgrade using amazons tradein program the lack of buttons hasnt been as issue since the page turns based off of which side you touch some reviews stated issues with the location of the power button causing it to turn off when holding it with the right hand and i did experience that same issue until putting it into the leather case i have been using it for the past several hours and have had no further issues with the location of the power button the brightness and warmth adjustment make the screen very easy on the eyes regardless of the ambient light around you my only complaint is that it is pretty heavy in the case compared to my old model and may cause issues with prolonged use since i have very small hands,937

"I recently dumped my consumer grade mesh network for a home built pfsense router and added these AP's along with the OC200 for management.  I have to say that the firmware upgraded has provided a fantastic experience mgt of wifi. Guest configuration including setting up basic captive portal and VLAN is easy. Signal in my home has never been better.  I have 3 AP's covering 3 floors without issue. Stability seems rock solid so far.<br /><br />Will continue to update as time goes on..<br /><br />9/8/2020<br />Still enjoying this product combined with their oc200 and my pfsense NUC. The OC200 makes mgt of your WiFi a breeze. Stability is fantastic and speeds are still rock solid. Roof mounting APs still beats mesh satellites sitting in various rooms. Setting up vlan and configuring a captive portal guest wifi were easy. I would still like to have some  additional reporting  and block functions related URLs at some level. Btw..the people complaining about the inability to get 300 Mg down close range. I get 350 pinned. I'm approximately 10 ft right now from one of my ap's.

More to come...<br /><br />20/27/2020<br />Can't find where my network is being throttled. Short of adding an access point from a competitor, I should clearly be exceeding 300 mb. The POE switch is a GS108PEv3, I have router with 1 gb ports (physical connection gets close to 1gb) and cat 6e cable throughout.  I have to assume it's something to do with the AP's. Tech support has sucked for lack of better words. (thanks for the canned FAQ that was useless..) Stability is great..but need this solved..<br /><br />Sept 2021<br />After several updates, further tuning, I am pleased with stability of the wifi and speeds. I am getting slightly better speeds.

"For the price I paid (under $40 for an open box pair) I think they sound really good. Though the marketing says they're bass heavy, I'd say they're more of a neutral can with a slight V sound. Mids are a little recessed compared to the lows and highs but it's not a sharp V. Detail and imaging is okay (probably not the best gaming cans), soundstage is pretty narrow. I don't need an amp for these.

"This is a decent, inexpensive webcam that does the job when it comes to video chatting and such. It comes delivered in a tiny cardboard box and does not have much in the way of instructions. It has no software that comes with it and no real user manual. Fortunately, the product is pretty much plug-and-play for Windows 10. I have not been able to test the product on other operating systems though. In Windows 10 at least the device is automatically recognized and the proper drivers are downloaded unless they are already installed on your computer.<br /><br />There is no real configuration of the camera that you can do. It has a fixed camera that you can adjust in position to get the best picture. This camera does seem to need plenty of light in order to get a good image. Without adequate lighting the picture gets grainy and difficult to see. There could perhaps be some software option for fixing this problem in high-end webcam apps but you can't really do much for it in programs like Skype or Facebook IM.<br /><br />To be sure, this is an inexpensive camera that produces less than professional results.

"This product gets 5 stars from me for peace of mind.  Does it have flaws? Yes,  but nothing I can't deal with.  Some of them include- touchy motion detection,  low level quality for night vision and sound quality is hit or miss. I've changed my motion settings multiple times so it is pretty much on my front porch and still, cars are setting it off. My house is set far enough back from our quiet street that this should not happen.  It is better now,  but does continue to occur daily.  As for night vision,  I must have my porch light on or the image quality is very poor and limited to about a foot from the doorbell. As for sound quality, it is not easy to have even a brief conversation, like they show in the commercials. The person at the door is easy to hear but they have difficulty hearing you, at least,  that's what we found in our tests.

"I have a love/😕relationship with my new kindle... I love everything about it except (&I knew this going into the purchase) it has no back up light. HOWEVER... with that being said, the reason I got it was to see it it helped with my eyes. I don't know how many suffer from quivering eyes after they read or work with a cellphone or reader with a back light, but I do and no matter what type of reader (& I've got lots of them) I tried, I still suffered from quivering eyes. So for the first time I decided to try one without a back light. From the first time I used my new kindle I have not suffered from quivering eyes (unless I read for more than 3 hrs) until I bounce back & forth between it and any device that has a back light. Makes driving so much more fun. I don't have to give up driving for reading or vice versa.  In the past if I had to do a lot of driving I would not read any of my ebooks... and I read so much, I'd have to take 5 or 10 books with me any time I traveled.  That's why I started using e-readers.. to be able to bring all my books in a small space. So yes, I love my new kindle but I miss the back light that was causing me so much trouble... grin ... but I don't miss the quivering eyes.",4.0,i have a loverelationship with my new kindle i love everything about it except i knew this going into the purchase it has no back up light however with that being said the reason i got it was to see it it helped with my eyes i dont know how many suffer from quivering eyes after they read or work with a cellphone or reader with a back light but i do and no matter what type of reader ive got lots of them i tried i still suffered from quivering eyes so for the first time i decided to try one without a back light from the first time i used my new kindle i have not suffered from quivering eyes unless i read for more than hrs until i bounce back forth between it and any device that has a back light makes driving so much more fun i dont have to give up driving for reading or vice versa in the past if i had to do a lot of driving i would not read any of my ebooks and i read so much id have to take or books with me any time i traveled thats why i started using ereaders to be able to bring all my books in a small space so yes i love my new kindle but i miss the back light that was causing me so much trouble grin but i dont miss the quivering eyes,1154

I got this tablet to replace my Asus memo 7.  I loved the asus until it started to have a persistant restart loop.  It would run for a while then restart for weeks on end.  Then it wouldnt crash for months on end.  Anyway i needed a small tablet with a decent amount of memory.  After months of hemming  and hawing and endless research I finally settled for this tablet.  I bought a open box one from amazon warehouse.  Tablet was perfect except they forgot to include the tool to open the memory card slot (thankfully a 0.5mm mechanical pencil tip will work).  Tablet fired up and google ttansfered all the data from my old tablet.  All went well and transfers were fast.  Tablet works well and is very fast.  Memory is not all bogged down with unwanted apps (less than 10 gigs used up).  I did clean and disable a bunch of stuff I dont want or use.  It took me a couple hours to get used to the nougut interface and get things squared away.  Battery life is great as i use the tablet for a good 6 hours and levels are still above 50%.  Need to work out the slow charge issue as charging overnight only brings me up to 94%  Im guessing its my powerbank.  Last night there was an update pushed out and this morning im showing the tablet no running Oreo sso thats a nice little bonus.  Camera is meh as is the sound.  The unlit soft keys is a real annoyance.  Samsung dropped the ball on that one and it warrents removing a star.  Also noticed there is no auto brightness featurse.  Thats a bummer.  Sound is poor for this level of tablet but that seeems par for the course in samsung tablets (our family owns 4 of them from a 2nd gen tab 2 to this one)  I dont use the tablet for music anyway and use headphone for watching vids.  Tablet is slippery so a good case is a must.  Screen does a decent job of hiding fingerprints but Im putting a tempered glass protector on it asap.  Tablet runs cool and even charging the temp never really climbs.  About the only thing I would change other than the other mentioned areas is the removal of all the samsung bloatware.  Its not a ton but its takes up space and I wont be using it so it stinks it cant be removed or at least disabled.  All in all im pretty happy and like having a tablet that doesnt reset every 45mins.,4.0,i got this tablet to replace my asus memo i loved the asus until it started to have a persistant restart loop it would run for a while then restart for weeks on end then it wouldnt crash for months on end anyway i needed a small tablet with a decent amount of memory after months of hemming and hawing and endless research i finally settled for this tablet i bought a open box one from amazon warehouse tablet was perfect except they forgot to include the tool to open the memory card slot thankfully a mm mechanical pencil tip will work tablet fired up and google ttansfered all the data from my old tablet all went well and transfers were fast tablet works well and is very fast memory is not all bogged down with unwanted apps less than gigs used up i did clean and disable a bunch of stuff i dont want or use it took me a couple hours to get used to the nougut interface and get things squared away battery life is great as i use the tablet for a good hours and levels are still above need to work out the slow charge issue as charging overnight only brings me up to im guessing its my powerbank last night there was an update pushed out and this morning im showing the tablet no running oreo sso thats a nice little bonus camera is meh as is the sound the unlit soft keys is a real annoyance samsung dropped the ball on that one and it warrents removing a star also noticed there is no auto brightness featurse thats a bummer sound is poor for this level of tablet but that seeems par for the course in samsung tablets our family owns of them from a nd gen tab to this one i dont use the tablet for music anyway and use headphone for watching vids tablet is slippery so a good case is a must screen does a decent job of hiding fingerprints but im putting a tempered glass protector on it asap tablet runs cool and even charging the temp never really climbs about the only thing i would change other than the other mentioned areas is the removal of all the samsung bloatware its not a ton but its takes up space and i wont be using it so it stinks it cant be removed or at least disabled all in all im pretty happy and like having a tablet that doesnt reset every mins,2172

"[[VIDEOID:d914a03b97e103a58bb9e4cb2b10c8ed]] This camera is cute which works satisfactorily. This is not a polaroid camera but a digital camera. My five-year-old granddaughter loves this toy. It is easy to take pictures, but for all other operations you need to read the instructions manual. The picture quality is reasonable for a kid, but it is little grainy as shown in the attached files. This instant print camera uses thermal printer technology that enables kids to take photos/videos & print photographs within seconds for coloring. The prints are black and white, and the coloring option is cool. It is a creative tool and inspires kids for imagination and artistry. There are five classic filters, eight special effects, and 20 cute cartoon frames. On the con, the camera prints every single shot without the option to discard pictures captured. I used the default settings; the video resolution at 1080p, camera resolution at 12mega pixel, and print mode at “Grey Print.” Some of the prints are shown here. Another cool feature is it is equipped with a 32 GB Micro SD card to store pictures and videos.

Have used Otterboxes on other Iphone models and my only concern is the longevity/durability of the rubber where it meets the hard shell just above where the power cord goes in which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.

"We purchased this digital frame as a shared sibling gift for my parents who are in their mid 80's. Very simply to use (important!) - they won't use the remote or all of the other functions (playing videos, music, etc.). The frame presents very clear pictures. We bought a 2 GB sandisk to go with the frame, and it holds a lot of pictures. Only surprise is that the frame won't show TIF files - we had taken a number of very high definition photos which the camera had recorded in a TIF format. There may be a work-around, but we haven't figured it out yet. Not a show stopper. I would definitely buy this frame again.",4.0,we purchased this digital frame as a shared sibling gift for my parents who are in their mid s very simply to use important they wont use the remote or all of the other functions playing videos music etc the frame presents very clear pictures we bought a gb sandisk to go with the frame and it holds a lot of pictures only surprise is that the frame wont show tif files we had taken a number of very high definition photos which the camera had recorded in a tif format there may be a workaround but we havent figured it out yet not a show stopper i would definitely buy this frame again,586
"My daughter and I set this computer up yesterday so my review is not based on weeks/months use of it.  However, I can probably tell you some things that might be good to know.  First of all, I am NOT computer techy and will not delve into the specs.  Besides, all that is already listed in the product description.  It runs on Windows 10, 64-bit. I'm not super-fond of any Windows platform for privacy reasons, but overall it seems to function well with few problems thus far.<br /><br />The set up was very easy.  Actually the most difficult part was clearing away the previous computer and all it's various components.  There is no separate CPU which I find to be absolutely delightful.  I actually have a nice, open space on the floor where the old one sat.  The CPU is inside the monitor, as well as the DVD drive.  It comes with all the cords you need, including a wireless mouse and keypad.  I was surprised that the sound from the monitor was much better than any other monitor with speakers I've ever used. It wasn't nearly what an audiophile would want, but good enough for basic listening needs.  I still attached my separate sound system because I love really good sound.  The Bluetooth function connected quickly to all my devices.<br /><br />The colors are vivid and defined, the monitor can be angled for different views, and everything is adjustable.  The included instruction showed a base plate for the monitor but mine did not have one.  The monitor stands just fine none-the-less.  The DVD drive is mounted on the right-side of the monitor and seems to work very well.  We had this up and running in about 20 minutes and we were moving kind of slowly.<br /><br />What did not work at all was the Netflix app.  It needs to be uninstalled and re-installed from the Google Play Store.  It will give an error code but it was an easy fix.  The Cortana feature on this computer only works when the computer is initially booted.  Afterwards it fails to hear although I have gone through the mike wizard set-up several times.  I don't know what is wrong with that but it might be something most people would like have working well.  Also, the mouse &#34;copy/paste&#34; function doesn't work. It will copy but you have physically hit &#34;control V&#34; to get it to paste.  It seems to be fast - it moves from webpage to webpage rapidly, movies and videos have yet to glitch, and......it' so quiet.  My previous computer was noisy all the time.  This one is so very, quite.....no cpu sounds at all.<br /><br />Overall so far:  I like it, I wish the Cortana worked like it's supposed too, it's fast and the monitor is large and clear.  Also it's touch screen so you can just touch any app on it to open it up. I'm actually to lazy to lean that far and prefer to use my mouse, but it seems to be a reliably working feature.  However, the touch screen makes it really easy and fast to delete a bunch of pictures.  I had a LOT of pictures from my kid's various science projects that I no longer needed and just touching the screen marking them for deletion was about 20x faster than using a mouse. I will definitely update this review as I use this computer more.  If anything malfunctions or is super wonderful I'll report back.  As of this review this computer costs $729.99.  It also has many various ports on the sides and rear and are very easy to access.",4.0,my daughter and i set this computer up yesterday so my review is not based on weeksmonths use of it however i can probably tell you some things that might be good to know first of all i am not computer techy and will not delve into the specs besides all that is already listed in the product description it runs on windows bit im not superfond of any windows platform for privacy reasons but overall it seems to function well with few problems thus farbr br the set up was very easy actually the most difficult part was clearing away the previous computer and all its various components there is no separate cpu which i find to be absolutely delightful i actually have a nice open space on the floor where the old one sat the cpu is inside the monitor as well as the dvd drive it comes with all the cords you need including a wireless mouse and keypad i was surprised that the sound from the monitor was much better than any other monitor with speakers ive ever used it wasnt nearly what an audiophile would want but good enough for basic listening needs i still attached my separate sound system because i love really good sound the bluetooth function connected quickly to all my devicesbr br the colors are vivid and defined the monitor can be angled for different views and everything is adjustable the included instruction showed a base plate for the monitor but mine did not have one the monitor stands just fine nonetheless the dvd drive is mounted on the rightside of the monitor and seems to work very well we had this up and running in about minutes and we were moving kind of slowlybr br what did not work at all was the netflix app it needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled from the google play store it will give an error code but it was an easy fix the cortana feature on this computer only works when the computer is initially booted afterwards it fails to hear although i have gone through the mike wizard setup several times i dont know what is wrong with that but it might be something most people would like have working well also the mouse copypaste function doesnt work it will copy but you have physically hit control v to get it to paste it seems to be fast it moves from webpage to webpage rapidly movies and videos have yet to glitch andit so quiet my previous computer was noisy all the time this one is so very quiteno cpu sounds at allbr br overall so far i like it i wish the cortana worked like its supposed too its fast and the monitor is large and clear also its touch screen so you can just touch any app on it to open it up im actually to lazy to lean that far and prefer to use my mouse but it seems to be a reliably working feature however the touch screen makes it really easy and fast to delete a bunch of pictures i had a lot of pictures from my kids various science projects that i no longer needed and just touching the screen marking them for deletion was about x faster than using a mouse i will definitely update this review as i use this computer more if anything malfunctions or is super wonderful ill report back as of this review this computer costs it also has many various ports on the sides and rear and are very easy to access,3178
These headphones  are great especially for active people. They are waterproof and work well. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is excellent.<br /><br />The problem lies within the engineering of the earplugs themselves. After 4 months of owning these there was a shortage in the wiring. After receiving a replacement there was a problem with charging them. The light wouldnt turn on so I was unaware when they were fully charged.<br /><br />This company has received over $35 of mine.

"Please note if you need to know the probable full cost.  You cannot charge the battery on your computer with the USB cable.  Garmin Express does not recognize this product.  (I know...hard to believe).  A typical wall charger does not have enough power to charge the battery with a USB cable.  You need a Wi-Fi connection to update maps and the time required can be longer longer than the battery life.  CONCLUSION;  you need a special wall charger.  If you stream music from your phone to your car’s speakers, the Garmin Smartphone app used for traffic and other features may prevent music streaming.  If so, Garmin’s HD Traffic cable will be necessary if you want both.  Garmin products are great though it is deceptive, in my view, to avoid making this situation clear and, at least, putting a charger in the box with a price adjustment.",4.0,please note if you need to know the probable full cost you cannot charge the battery on your computer with the usb cable garmin express does not recognize this product i knowhard to believe a typical wall charger does not have enough power to charge the battery with a usb cable you need a wifi connection to update maps and the time required can be longer longer than the battery life conclusion you need a special wall charger if you stream music from your phone to your cars speakers the garmin smartphone app used for traffic and other features may prevent music streaming if so garmins hd traffic cable will be necessary if you want both garmin products are great though it is deceptive in my view to avoid making this situation clear and at least putting a charger in the box with a price adjustment,805

"Much has already been said about this device so I will keep my comments brief. This was a replacement for a Kindle Keyboard I've had and enjoyed for years. I'm happy I made the switch. I find it easy to use, and when reading it's just as seamless as turning the pages of a paper book - once you are used to the controls the device itself fades into the background, which is the point. I do find that sometimes the touchscreen seems a little finicky; occasionally it doesn't register a tap for a page turn, or turns more than one page at a time, but this is a pretty minor thing. The other thing that sometimes gets annoying is that, for whatever strange reason, it is too easy to change the font size with a random bump on the screen. Maybe it's just me but if I carry the device with the cover open and my hand slips onto the screen it just seems to always go to the change font menu and I end up with a screen of wonky-sized text.",4.0,much has already been said about this device so i will keep my comments brief this was a replacement for a kindle keyboard ive had and enjoyed for years im happy i made the switch i find it easy to use and when reading its just as seamless as turning the pages of a paper book once you are used to the controls the device itself fades into the background which is the point i do find that sometimes the touchscreen seems a little finicky occasionally it doesnt register a tap for a page turn or turns more than one page at a time but this is a pretty minor thing the other thing that sometimes gets annoying is that for whatever strange reason it is too easy to change the font size with a random bump on the screen maybe its just me but if i carry the device with the cover open and my hand slips onto the screen it just seems to always go to the change font menu and i end up with a screen of wonkysized text,910
"OK, the thing people need to take into account here is that these Cyyber Acoustics ACM-70 Headphones are extremely cheap (price). I paid only about $7 here on Amazon for them.<br /><br />If you're looking for high-quality sonics, amazing music listening, rich bass, or extreme quality, these are not for you. I would also not recommend them for small portable listening, since they're not very discreet and the cord is long (however, the fact that the cord is long is a GOOD thing for those of us who need to sit some distance from our computer or other device).<br /><br />If all you need is a cheap way to listen to your audio without disturbing others, and you're not concerned with frequency range like a major audiphile would be, these are fine.<br /><br />Perfect for just surfing videos on the web and casual use. Music is OK, but don't expect beefy low-end tones or nice wide frequency ranges.<br /><br />For 7 bucks, they sound just fine and get the job done.

"Thank you B&O for sending these H8i headphones almost fully charged.  I jumped right into the setup and am listening to various genres of music as I write this.<br />Begin by downloading the app.<br /><br />The scant instruction manual is almost useless unless you want to learn 17 different languages.  (I actually found it interesting to see how each paragraph looked in other languages.)  Download the manual from the app if you need more than the poorly labeled drawings provided or tire of looking for the sentences written in a language you can comprehend.<br /><br />Pairing to my Samsung phone was simple and took a little over a minute.<br />I had a friend call me and we agreed that our voices were very clear; most likely due to the dual microphone setup.  As with any headphone system it takes a time or two to get used to the controls; a quick push of the center button to answer then hold the same button for a couple of seconds to hang up.<br /><br />The noise cancelling trait is pretty darned good.  While listening to a country tune at a medium low level I cranked up the TV.  When I could barely hear any TV noise I then turned the noise cancellation off and was surprised at how high the TV volume actually was.  As much as I love my ancient (1st Gen) BOSE ANC headphones, the Bang & Olufsen headphones are slightly better at cancelling nearby environmental noise.<br />I find the sound quality to be good, but was truthfully expecting it to be better.  I have 2 other pairs of headphones and would say the sound quality of these B&O’s are not much better than my Panasonic Wireless Retro Over-the-Ear headphones or Audio-Technica Wireless Over-the-Ear headphones.  In fairness, I am not an audiophile, therefore my opinion on sound quality may not carry much weight.  Plus over the ear vs. on the ear are inherently different in how sound reaches the inner ear.  The B&O’s have crisp treble, clear mid-range and solid bass.  Perhaps the brand (B&O) raised my expectations.<br /><br />I appreciate the 30 hour battery life.  No more getting upset with myself because I forgot to charge them over night every night.<br /><br />I have one complaint, the headband is uncomfortable.  Almost too heavy so it slips if I turn too fast or lean back quickly.  The fabric housing the padded underside of the headband is woven and pulled so tightly that it becomes somewhat slippery.  However, the leather band on the external side of the headband is most likely what is making it feel too heavy.  Additionally, I think that leather band makes the headphones look cheap and tacky.  It’s slapped on there like a strap from Grandma's cheap purse.<br /><br />I would recommend the Bang & Olufsen H8i headphones.  Great sound and great battery life.

"Just needed a throwaway pair of headphones, was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I like the angled plug<br /><br />The foam eartips are very comfortable (very similar to the nice comply TX-100 eartips)  and isolate very well. The two silicone options are also very good, but a few more tips would have been nice, even if it cost a dollar more.<br /><br />They're quite light and don't weight down your ears.<br /><br />I like the over ear wire, it's very unintrusive. I find the ones with little wire ear pieces to get REALLY painful, but the thin, light wire is completely unnoticeable.  instead of the earpiece, it has a tiny brass weight that just holds the wires down, which winds up working REALLY well.<br /><br />I don't plan on using them for workouts, but if I were, the only thing I'd want is a chin cinch. That's the only thing these are missing. Running is probably fine, but if you're a jumpy crossfit type, you might be able to bounce the wires off your ears.<br /><br />The fit and finish is quite nice, though the parts are built down to a price. Not the greatest wire, but it seems serviceable, there's good stress relief on the plug and Y, and there's no rough or sharp edges.<br /><br />The sound quality is exceptional. I'd say that I have a hard time telling these apart from my $100 klipsch IEM's. It's a nice moderate tone, there's plenty of base but it's not muddy or overhwhelming. Very tight and clean. The mids are the only place you can hear any faltering, and it's just a TINY bit muted. Highs are plenty clear and clean. And that's without any burn-in.<br /><br />Can't speak to the in-line mic, but it responds to google voice commands just fine. It's just a one-button remote, so you only have a pause/play option. No volume control. double click it to skip a song, hold to enable voice commands, Voice commands can be used to set volume, but it's more than just a click.<br /><br />My only four small gripes are the small number of earpieces (the foam tips do kinda make up for it, but the other two are great if they fit your ears. I have medium sized ear-canals and the smaller silicone tips are perfect), I wish it had volume controls on the mic, a chin cinch for exercise, and that it doesn't come with a case of any sort. I'd have gladly paid an extra few bucks for those things.<br /><br />Also not great option for motorcycle helmets, they stick out a little far for that.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these though.

"I am currently using this to pair my laptop/Android phone to my VIZIO VHT215 soundbar. I have no previous experience with these adapters so can not compare it to others.

"Pros:<br />1) Can give temporary codes to others.<br />2) Can designate specific time/day that guest codes work.<br />3) Remote control of your deadbolt lock via iPhone/Android app or web interface ($0.99/month)<br />4) Receive text and/or e-mail alerts when a guest enters their code with their name (additional $0.99/month).<br />5) Runs on AA batteries that last pretty long (based on settings)<br />6) No $100 Zwave or Zigbee hub needed like Schlage and other remote deadbolts.<br />7) No compatible phone needed to grant others access.<br />8) Can create an automatic lock/unlock schedule (for example, to lock automatically at 10pm each night)<br />9) Can create group schedules for guest codes.<br />10) Subscripton not required if you don't need remote features.<br />11) Quality construction and finish.<br />12) Easy installation.<br />13) Consolidated app if you use their other products.<br />One app to control remotely control your lock, thermostat, webcam, outlets, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) App has limited functionality. Just locks and unlocks the door remotely.<br />2) Must use web interface to create new guest codes and manage the lock remotely.<br />3) App isn't the most reliable/consistent.<br />4) Notifications are sometimes delayed/dropped (rarely)<br />5) Yet to be determined if it will work with home automation schemes.<br /><br />I purchased this WiFi deadbolt keypad before it was released to the general public, so I don't pay any subscription fees (Kickstarter). I hate subscription fees, but a buck or two a month is a small price to pay for the convenience this thing provides. I give my neighbor a code when I am working long days and she lets my dog out for me when I am gone. I get a text, so that I know things are taken care of. Priceless. I used to frequently forget to lock the door when I leave the house, so its nice to be able to check its status remotely and close it if one forgets or put it on a schedule to remotely lock itself automatically. As mentioned in the Pro's, you can assign different people different codes so that when they enter their code, you get a notification that that person unlocked the door. Notifications can be delayed or dropped infrequently, but it does happen. You can view a log history of who unlocked the door when and when it was locked. You can also view a &#34;last 3 heartbeat&#34; of the last three times the lock updated its status to LockstateConnect's servers.<br /><br />This brings me to battery life. You can decide how often the lock connects to WiFi. If WiFi is on continuously, it would drain the AA batteries in a couple days. I would recommend to have it update continuously ONLY when you are first setting it up, so that you can test operate it and make sure that the remote functions work. After that, set it to update something like every 30 minutes. Batteries should last several months, maybe almost a year at this setting. This is what will result from having it not being connected constantly: When you tell it to lock remotely, it will not lock until the next time it connects, so there would be a maximum 30 minute delay if you told it to lock immediately after the last time it connected. Could be no delay. Just depends how the times line up. For unlocking the door, the same would apply BUT if somebody presses a button on the lock's keypad, it will connect and unlock the door at that time. That way, if somebody is at your door, you send the unlock signal, they press a button and it unlocks, so they won't have to wait up to 30 minutes for it to happen. Technically, the same would apply to locking, but it doesn't really serve much purpose in that scenario.<br /><br />I am very happy with this lock. The inconsistent app performance is the only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars.<br />You should be aware that there are other &#34;connected&#34; lock brands (that are out or coming out soon) that are more likely to work with home automation schemes. Lockitron comes to mind.<br /><br />A few Pros and Cons with Lockitron:<br />Pros:<br />1) Don't need to remember a code. When your phone's Bluetooth comes in range, it unlocks the door for you.<br />2) You can send temporary acces to someone else's phone (by text, I think).<br />3) More likely to interface with upcomming home automation gadgets.<br />4) a. Don't have to change your existing deadbolt, Lockitron attaches to it.<br />b. You don't need to change your key.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Looks cheap. Like one of those &#34;remotes&#34; that used to turn a TV's channel changer dial, back in the 70's.<br />2) Without a phone with he most current Bluetooh standard, neither you or your guest can unlock the door from outside.<br />3) IT MAY UNLOCK THE DOOR FOR STRANGERS!<br />The lock doesn't know if you are on the inside of the door or the outside of the door.<br />Picture this... You have your door locked and someone knocks at the door. You go to the door to see who it is.<br />Lockitron thinks you are on the outside trying to get in, so it unlocks the door before you can see who is there.<br />A solution to this would be to NOT keep

"After using surge protection for audio, video and computer equipment for more than 30 years I can definitely say not all of these products are created equally.<br /><br />While surge protectors will often boast of great protection, more often than not they are more multi outlet plugs rather than actual protection.<br /><br />I have thoroughly tested this surge protector and it has passed all of my testing.  While only rated for 700 joules, this is typically adequate especially when your home has proper grounding.  Often similar devices pass my tests initially yet fail after the 1 or 3 month mark - that has not been the case with this item.<br /><br />The way this is designed allowed me to utilize this in my bathroom to have all of my toiletry accessories charging at once yet have everything compact and tucked away.  It’s nice that this doubles as a nightlight that has adjustable levels of light and automatically turns on and off.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different was if on the sides the outlets were more widely spaced to allow for larger power blocks - with that being said having 6 outlets should allow most users to have more than enough.<br /><br />The 3 USB ports are definitely a nice addition as this helps avoid having to use plugs for USB powered devices.

"I'm not an audiophile, but I've tried out a good number of different earbud brands lately, all across the quality spectrum. I'm grading on a curve here.<br /><br />Packaging is sufficient. A few tip sizes, quick start, instructions, and whatever is in that other manual of junk I always throw away. The earbud case is lozenge shaped and pocketable enough. No external lights, which is nice if you're charging it next to your bed, but not so much if you want to know their charge status.<br /><br />They are supposed to immediately start trying to bluetooth pair with something when first opened, and appeared to be trying to do so. My Surface was unable to locate them. I even tried with a second Surface. I plugged in the case and left it to charge for 15 minutes, and then they paired fine. Overall on unboxing and setup, I'd say they're adequate, but far from exceptional.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves are aggressively visible. I assume they're trying to ride the I-Pod branding success, but I'm not really feeling it. Despite looking huge, they don't feel huge. They are lightweight and comfortable. They don't feel like they are going to fall out, despite not feeling like they're crammed in the ear. Fit is unusual in that you can turn the earbud like a screw to make it tighter or looser. Sound is good. I'm giving them very low marks for appearance, and very good for fit and sound.<br /><br />These use swipe style controls, which I despise. I much prefer a physical button that I can just feel that I've clicked. The controls do work as advertised, but there's enough delay that it often takes me a while of swiping my ear and waiting until it gets the message. Mostly irritating when someone tries to talk to me and I can't get it to pause for several seconds.<br /><br />Range is average.<br /><br />Overall, Id' say there's a bit of a brand name premium on the price compared to some other products, and I'm saying that as someone who has used Surface products as my primary computers for many years now, but they're not bad. I've definitely tried more expensive earbuds that weren't as good, but of what I've tried, I'm happiest so far with the Jabra Elite series of earbuds.",4.0,im not an audiophile but ive tried out a good number of different earbud brands lately all across the quality spectrum im grading on a curve herebr br packaging is sufficient a few tip sizes quick start instructions and whatever is in that other manual of junk i always throw away the earbud case is lozenge shaped and pocketable enough no external lights which is nice if youre charging it next to your bed but not so much if you want to know their charge statusbr br they are supposed to immediately start trying to bluetooth pair with something when first opened and appeared to be trying to do so my surface was unable to locate them i even tried with a second surface i plugged in the case and left it to charge for minutes and then they paired fine overall on unboxing and setup id say theyre adequate but far from exceptionalbr br the earbuds themselves are aggressively visible i assume theyre trying to ride the ipod branding success but im not really feeling it despite looking huge they dont feel huge they are lightweight and comfortable they dont feel like they are going to fall out despite not feeling like theyre crammed in the ear fit is unusual in that you can turn the earbud like a screw to make it tighter or looser sound is good im giving them very low marks for appearance and very good for fit and soundbr br these use swipe style controls which i despise i much prefer a physical button that i can just feel that ive clicked the controls do work as advertised but theres enough delay that it often takes me a while of swiping my ear and waiting until it gets the message mostly irritating when someone tries to talk to me and i cant get it to pause for several secondsbr br range is averagebr br overall id say theres a bit of a brand name premium on the price compared to some other products and im saying that as someone who has used surface products as my primary computers for many years now but theyre not bad ive definitely tried more expensive earbuds that werent as good but of what ive tried im happiest so far with the jabra elite series of earbuds,2083
"Overall, this is a very nice golf GPS for the price. I was a little worried about it being too complicated to use, but the manual explains all the features in reasonably good detail. I found it helpful to keep the manual with me the first couple of times I used it on the course to refer to, but after a few outings I felt comfortable using it.<br /><br />I had an initial problem with the battery life in that it quit on me after about an hour of use. After leaving it in the charging cradle overnight, the next time it maintained its charge for a full afternoon's use. I've used it (and recharged it) several times since then and have had no problems, so it seems the first time was just a momentary glitch (or perhaps I didn't seat the charging cable firmly enough).<br /><br />I very much like that it does not require a subscription to use, nor does it need to be tethered to a PC for the initial setup. It has a pretty extensive database of courses (Izzo says on their website that they cover 90% of the courses in the US). You can use their website to look up a course to see if it is included in the database.<br /><br />Sat acquisition times is quick - took only a few minutes to get a lock and find my course the first time I used it. Acquisition time was even faster on subsequent uses. It uses a SiRF Star III receiver.<br /><br />The display is clear even in sunlight, but it is a bit small for me. I don't usually have my reading glasses with me when I'm outdoors, so seeing the distance numbers took quite a bit of squinting. Granted, if you don't have aging eyes you won't find that to be a problem, but it would have been nice to have a larger display.<br /><br />I also didn't find it all that comfortable to wear. It is lightweight and not too thick, but the strap was not very comfortable. Plus the greenish/yellow accent color (found on the inside of the strap and the sides of the unit) didn't appeal to me much - rather garish looking to my eye.<br /><br />The warranty is only 90 days, which I think is too short given the price -- a year would be more appropriate.<br /><br />But those are minor quibbles. Overall, the functionality is great - quick to acquire sats, accurate distances and straightforward to use. Considering the price of other brands, such as Garmin, this is a great value. Definitely should be on the short list if you're shopping for a golf GPS.<br /><br />[As an aside, it's a real bear to the product out of the clamshell packaging. I didn't' factor that into the rating, but set aside some time to wrestle it out of the plastic jail it comes in should you buy one.]",4.0,overall this is a very nice golf gps for the price i was a little worried about it being too complicated to use but the manual explains all the features in reasonably good detail i found it helpful to keep the manual with me the first couple of times i used it on the course to refer to but after a few outings i felt comfortable using itbr br i had an initial problem with the battery life in that it quit on me after about an hour of use after leaving it in the charging cradle overnight the next time it maintained its charge for a full afternoons use ive used it and recharged it several times since then and have had no problems so it seems the first time was just a momentary glitch or perhaps i didnt seat the charging cable firmly enoughbr br i very much like that it does not require a subscription to use nor does it need to be tethered to a pc for the initial setup it has a pretty extensive database of courses izzo says on their website that they cover of the courses in the us you can use their website to look up a course to see if it is included in the databasebr br sat acquisition times is quick took only a few minutes to get a lock and find my course the first time i used it acquisition time was even faster on subsequent uses it uses a sirf star iii receiverbr br the display is clear even in sunlight but it is a bit small for me i dont usually have my reading glasses with me when im outdoors so seeing the distance numbers took quite a bit of squinting granted if you dont have aging eyes you wont find that to be a problem but it would have been nice to have a larger displaybr br i also didnt find it all that comfortable to wear it is lightweight and not too thick but the strap was not very comfortable plus the greenishyellow accent color found on the inside of the strap and the sides of the unit didnt appeal to me much rather garish looking to my eyebr br the warranty is only days which i think is too short given the price a year would be more appropriatebr br but those are minor quibbles overall the functionality is great quick to acquire sats accurate distances and straightforward to use considering the price of other brands such as garmin this is a great value definitely should be on the short list if youre shopping for a golf gpsbr br as an aside its a real bear to the product out of the clamshell packaging i didnt factor that into the rating but set aside some time to wrestle it out of the plastic jail it comes in should you buy one,2482

"Packaging was a bit mediocre. A cardboard card with the strap through it in a dingy plastic bag. Strap appears to be new/unused and in good condition.<br /><br />This fits my Kodak Z990 digital camera perfectly. A much more comfortable carrying solution than the thin strap Kodak included with the camera.<br /><br />I'm a heavyset guy and with the strap nowhere near as long as it could be adjusted to I have the camera hanging just at arm's length. I can comfortably hold the camera by my side while I walk around.<br /><br />Adjusting the fit isn't easy which is good. This means your strap isn't going to slip (my Kodak loosened up all the time). It make take a little effort and time but it secures the camera well.<br /><br />The padded section of the neck strap could be a little longer. The swivel hinges and spring clips which hold the mounting strap to the padded neck band catch me right in the collarbone. The spring loaded clips feel sturdy and don't seem like they can accidentally be released. The padding itself is very comfortable on my neck. I feel like I could carry my camera for hours without and discomfort.<br /><br />My only complaint, as minor as it may be, is the product labels stitched to the padded section of the strap system. The padding is soft and the labels well stitched in place. They couldn't be ripped out so I had to spend a few minutes carefully trimming them (there are several different tags) away with a pair of scissors.<br /><br />This is a nice update to the basic straps many manufacturers send out with their products.

"So this is a very large screen set up for a big room or outdoor use. That being said, there's also a reason they included stakes and rope in the kit--this thing is basically a sail and will fly away if outside and not properly secured.<br /><br />The good:<br />- The screen is very large and the ""rig"" does a good job of stretching the screen taut; no wrinkles!<br />- Lightweight kit overall<br />- Can be wall or tripod mounted<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />- Personally, getting this kit, laying it all out and putting it together... I found it really annoying. There were moments when I felt like that inept person trying to work a gadget on an infomercial. You know what I'm talking about. But seriously, having six different poles fitting into these holes, then stretching the screen to get all the grommets looped was... annoying. Nothing was described inaccurately in the description, and looking at it online, you think--hey, that doesn't look so bad. And it's not like it was HARD... but the whole process was obnoxious and not something I want to put up, take down, put up, take down, etc.<br />- No carrying bag or case is included with the kit, so all these pieces are just free floating through your life waiting to get lost if you only use this thing periodically. Find a nice box or bag to keep everything in, because there isn't one provided (again, it doesn't say there is... but something like this REALLY needs it even a cheap nylon number. Please.)<br />- Suuuper top-heavy and will easily fall or blow over if not indoors or properly secured.<br />- Screen is kind of see-through. Which would be fine if you were rear-projecting. But you can't do that, because of the rods... so... Works best in lower light conditions.<br /><br />Good to know:<br />- The kit includes command strips to affix the center rod-hub to the wall. The size of this thing is really not conducive to that method of hanging, honestly. If you use command strips and posters fall down, this will too. Fortunately, it also includes actual screws... which is probably what I'm going to use to just put the whole thing up on the wall and not have to deal with putting it up, taking it down, putting it up, taking it down...",4.0,so this is a very large screen set up for a big room or outdoor use that being said theres also a reason they included stakes and rope in the kitthis thing is basically a sail and will fly away if outside and not properly securedbr br the goodbr the screen is very large and the rig does a good job of stretching the screen taut no wrinklesbr lightweight kit overallbr can be wall or tripod mountedbr br the notsogoodbr personally getting this kit laying it all out and putting it together i found it really annoying there were moments when i felt like that inept person trying to work a gadget on an infomercial you know what im talking about but seriously having six different poles fitting into these holes then stretching the screen to get all the grommets looped was annoying nothing was described inaccurately in the description and looking at it online you thinkhey that doesnt look so bad and its not like it was hard but the whole process was obnoxious and not something i want to put up take down put up take down etcbr no carrying bag or case is included with the kit so all these pieces are just free floating through your life waiting to get lost if you only use this thing periodically find a nice box or bag to keep everything in because there isnt one provided again it doesnt say there is but something like this really needs it even a cheap nylon number pleasebr suuuper topheavy and will easily fall or blow over if not indoors or properly securedbr screen is kind of seethrough which would be fine if you were rearprojecting but you cant do that because of the rods so works best in lower light conditionsbr br good to knowbr the kit includes command strips to affix the center rodhub to the wall the size of this thing is really not conducive to that method of hanging honestly if you use command strips and posters fall down this will too fortunately it also includes actual screws which is probably what im going to use to just put the whole thing up on the wall and not have to deal with putting it up taking it down putting it up taking it down,2069

"This Nexigo camera is overall an outstanding camera. The picture quality is among the best out of any camera I've used. It's crisp and clear and doesn't distort when zooming or panning. The menu is good and has some great features, like the ability to turn on a black and white filter as part of the built-in camera software. You can even preset zoom settings to return to at a touch of a button. I like using the remote better than an AI camera (which I've also used). While AI PTZ can be nice, sometimes you end up fighting it, when the camera moves or zooms when you don't actually want it to. I like having a higher level of control with this remote.<br /><br />That being said, I also use ManyCam to do streaming when I teach. I've found the camera works well with some elements of the streaming software, but not with others.<br /><br />In ManyCam, using features like backgrounds and objects seem to disable the menu, zoom, pan and focus functions of the camera. They just don't work anymore--so you have to make sure you've got the camera set where you want it before you turn those things on. You CAN still use bottom-third objects without disabling pan and zoom though, which is good.<br /><br />In Teams, I haven't had any issues still using pan and zoom with the remote when I've got a virtual background up, but I the menu doesn't show.

If everyone would start using these there would be a lot less cyber crime. Unfortunately at this time it's usage is still limited for a lot of things.

I tested the app that they are using to login to Windows and it's no where near working right and still allowing you to use the Yubi Key as MFA.  It has two programmable slots that are a little difficult to figure out which one you are working with.  I am still going to talk more with Yubico about these issues and see if I am missing something.  I downloaded the manager software and the personalization software.  They are not very user friendly but that isn't my issue.  These keys work great right out of the box for normal MFA/2FA purposes.  I just want to be able to use it for more then that personally.

Living about 25 miles outside town there were some stations I was having problems with (since the switch over to digital). I was under the impression that an antenna was an antenna and these so-call 'digital' or 'HDTV' antennas were just the same-old stuff with a new buzz word attached. Then I happened to watch a documentary on fractals and one of the practical applications they showed for those were new designs in antenna technology. So when I saw these ultra thin antennas on sale I figured I would give one a try. I bought one of the non-amplified ones to start (the rabbit ears set I was using was amplified). I have to say that this new antenna does work somewhat better than what I was using. Still have some weak channels, but there is about a 25% increase in overall signal strength - which is enough to now be able to watch those weaker stations.<br /><br />I like that you get a set of push-pins to mount the antenna yo the wall, I was planing on using something like that and was glad I didn't need to find some. I also like that there is a choice of colors (black or white). I just wish the cable was a more neutral color.

"I have had this camera about a week and absolutely love most things about it. Super fast focusing, great low light performance, awesome pictures, superb macros, stunning lcd display, great body, and the list goes on. You've seen it all in the other reviews. It's a wonderful camera that I can carry with me for strolls and spur-of-the-moment shots. I would love to have been able to use this for street photography, but because Canon saw fit to do away with the articulated tilt screen, this is not so very practicable now. It's so much easier to get great candid shots of people when you're not so obviously balancing a camera out in front of you at chin level or higher, trying to compose your shot. With a tilt screen or articulated screen you just casually hang your head to look down at the screen, and a quiet, incognito, stealth shot, with the camera hanging low in front at chest level, is so much easier to carry off discreetly and without bringing attention to yourself. With a fixed screen - not. Huge disappointment in that department. What was Canon thinking? Did someone at the design meeting say: ""Gentlemen, perhaps we should step back a pace. This camera is so awesome that if we included the tilt screen, like we did for its last 3 predecessors, we'd leave the competition choking in our wake. That would not be fair. Gotta keep the competitors healthy and happy. Let's ditch the tilt screen."" How logical was that???<br /><br />So, now I'm faced with trying to decide between this camera and its close competitor the very cool, but somewhat slower-to-focus Nikon P7700. Also, the Nikon's flash is virtually unusable on macro photos because it casts the lens' shadow over your subject. Even though the Nikon also has a 20x zoom lens in its favor and many other awesome features, that slower focus is kind of off-putting... After all, usually you want to actually capture ""that"" moment, not the one that comes 2.5 seconds later. Also, I love macro photography and really resent that shadow. Who designed that flash anyway???<br /><br />Hence, my dilemma. What to do...?  What to do...?",4.0,i have had this camera about a week and absolutely love most things about it super fast focusing great low light performance awesome pictures superb macros stunning lcd display great body and the list goes on youve seen it all in the other reviews its a wonderful camera that i can carry with me for strolls and spurofthemoment shots i would love to have been able to use this for street photography but because canon saw fit to do away with the articulated tilt screen this is not so very practicable now its so much easier to get great candid shots of people when youre not so obviously balancing a camera out in front of you at chin level or higher trying to compose your shot with a tilt screen or articulated screen you just casually hang your head to look down at the screen and a quiet incognito stealth shot with the camera hanging low in front at chest level is so much easier to carry off discreetly and without bringing attention to yourself with a fixed screen not huge disappointment in that department what was canon thinking did someone at the design meeting say gentlemen perhaps we should step back a pace this camera is so awesome that if we included the tilt screen like we did for its last predecessors wed leave the competition choking in our wake that would not be fair gotta keep the competitors healthy and happy lets ditch the tilt screen how logical was thatbr br so now im faced with trying to decide between this camera and its close competitor the very cool but somewhat slowertofocus nikon p also the nikons flash is virtually unusable on macro photos because it casts the lens shadow over your subject even though the nikon also has a x zoom lens in its favor and many other awesome features that slower focus is kind of offputting after all usually you want to actually capture that moment not the one that comes seconds later also i love macro photography and really resent that shadow who designed that flash anywaybr br hence my dilemma what to do what to do,1993

"Many cars on the market come with a rear-view camera that allows for seeing where the vehicle is moving when in reverse. Often the view appears on a dashboard screen. This is handy when parking and maneuvering while the vehicle is backing up. For vehicles that do not have a rear-view camera the alternative is to add on a kit that provides the same functionality. This is my first experience with such a kit and so far I am pleased with it. It does require doing a little work on the vehicle to set it up but the effort is worth it.<br /><br />The package contains everything needed to set up this camera system. In addition to the camera and the screen, the kit includes the mounting screws for the actual camera as well as all of the wiring to connect everything together and to the power (reverse lights). There is also a mini-remote for interacting with the video screen though this is slightly inconvenient.<br /><br />I spent a good deal of time reading and rereading the directions and concluded that the instructions could have been better. There are three pieces of documentation in the box; one shows a generalized set of four different configurations for connecting everything together (the fourth diagram on this sheet matches the configuration you want), one is a photocopied image of a wired system and the third is a “User’s Manual” which is one half-sheet of paper with a brief summarization of the product. There really needs to be a better documentation set than this.<br /><br />If you are not skilled in working with electrical systems, either plan on this taking a good while or have someone you trust install the system. It’s not especially hard to set one of these up, but it does take some patience and a little bit of knowledge of the layout of the car’s wiring. I have worked on car electrical systems in the distant past so I had a vague familiarity, but it still took me a while to have everything set up and working.<br /><br />Once wired the system is fairly straightforward to use. If it is wired up properly (meaning everything is connected to power on both ends and the two main components can see one another) it works nicely. The image when the camera is feeding to the monitor is bright and reasonably clear; the brightness can be adjusted as needed which helps when using this system at night. Another reviewer commented that he used a different camera connected to this system - while I am personally satisfied with the image quality, it’s reassuring to know that you can use another video camera if desired or necessary.<br /><br />The addition of the remote will appeal to some, but for me it’s a component that can easily be lost. The menu system on the monitor provides the same functionality as the remote and this is good enough for me.<br /><br />This is my first experience with rear-view video systems and though it gave me a little trouble setting up it was from lack of good documentation and inexperience, not from being a bad product. Once installed this is a nice and easy-to-use video system. Time will tell how long it works.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I recently acquired a pair of Able Planet Sound Clarity (SC hereafter) headphones, just 6 days after purchasing a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 15 Noise Canceling headphones (QC15 hereafter). I got a very good deal on the Able Planet phones, which is the main reason I bought them. With both sets in hand, I have been able to do a side-by-side comparison between them. Bose is generally regarded as the Gold Standard when it comes to active noise canceling phones so this review is spun in that regard. I have not had a chance to try the Sennheiser offerings, so I cannot comment on those.<br /><br />In summary, the Able Planet phones compare reasonably well against the Bose phones, but there are some trade-offs between the two. Which set to buy depends on the personal preferences and intended uses.<br /><br />First off, the phones look very similar to one another. The general design is the same, with an over-the-ear design, soft pads and an on-off switch for noise cancellation. There are some very distinct differences, though, that are not obvious at a glance. First, the detachable cord plugs in somewhat differently, the SC having a jack that this flush with the phone and the QC15 having a jack that is inset within the base of the phone, with a molded plug. The battery compartment is also accessed differently, the SC having a sliding cover exposing 2 AAA batteries and the QC15 having a flip-up cover for a single AAA battery.<br /><br />Another visible difference is in the cord that is included with the SC phones - it has a volume control thumb wheel. The QC15 phones have simply on/off. I like being able to adjust the volume without fiddling with the source such as a computer.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, Bose has an upper hand on Able Planet. While both have an over-the-ear design which covers the ear, the SC cup is a hair smaller and as such it cannot cover the whole ear as easily as the QC15. That said, the SC phones are still comfortable and the difference is minor.<br /><br />The noise canceling aspect of the SC phones is very good but it does not compare to the QC15 headset. Standing next to a running air handler that is roughly the size of a minivan, the SC is able to wipe out a good portion of the noise to make the level comfortable. The QC15 wiped out the sound of the air handler completely, to the point that it was difficult to tell if it was even turned on.<br /><br />I was interested in the Linx Audio aspect of the SC phones and at first I was very disappointed. The high range is somewhat dampened, ""S"" sometimes sounding like ""PH"". However, the mid and low ranges are solid and are very rich, whereas Bose sounds good but has remarkably less depth. The QC15 phones are primarily noise canceling phones, and sound quality is secondary to that. The SC headset achieves a better balance of sound to noise canceling.<br /><br />Once very distinct advantage that the SC headset has is that the phones will work without power, though noise canceling does not work in that case. The QC15 requires a working battery and must be turned on to work at all.<br /><br />Right out of the box, my SC phones were defective. I contacted Able Planet, hoping I could get some advice on how to adjust them, but instead I got an RMA number. Less than 2 weeks later I had a new, working pair in my hands that work much better than the initial pair. Customer service at Able Planet is very responsive, professional and courteous. With the LIFETIME warranty on their headphones, Bose cannot answer with their 2-year warranty.<br /><br />Which pair to buy is a matter of preference and intended use. If the intended primary use is noise cancellation and comfort, Bose is the right choice. For listening to music with the ability to engage noise canceling when needed, Able Planet is a better choice. Considering the 2-year Bose warranty against an Able Planet lifetime warranty, though, is hard to ignore.<br /><br />As I use my phones for listening to music more than anything else, I use the Able Planet headset as my primary headset and I keep my Bose headset as a backup.",4.0,i recently acquired a pair of able planet sound clarity sc hereafter headphones just days after purchasing a pair of bose quiet comfort noise canceling headphones qc hereafter i got a very good deal on the able planet phones which is the main reason i bought them with both sets in hand i have been able to do a sidebyside comparison between them bose is generally regarded as the gold standard when it comes to active noise canceling phones so this review is spun in that regard i have not had a chance to try the sennheiser offerings so i cannot comment on thosebr br in summary the able planet phones compare reasonably well against the bose phones but there are some tradeoffs between the two which set to buy depends on the personal preferences and intended usesbr br first off the phones look very similar to one another the general design is the same with an overtheear design soft pads and an onoff switch for noise cancellation there are some very distinct differences though that are not obvious at a glance first the detachable cord plugs in somewhat differently the sc having a jack that this flush with the phone and the qc having a jack that is inset within the base of the phone with a molded plug the battery compartment is also accessed differently the sc having a sliding cover exposing aaa batteries and the qc having a flipup cover for a single aaa batterybr br another visible difference is in the cord that is included with the sc phones it has a volume control thumb wheel the qc phones have simply onoff i like being able to adjust the volume without fiddling with the source such as a computerbr br comfortwise bose has an upper hand on able planet while both have an overtheear design which covers the ear the sc cup is a hair smaller and as such it cannot cover the whole ear as easily as the qc that said the sc phones are still comfortable and the difference is minorbr br the noise canceling aspect of the sc phones is very good but it does not compare to the qc headset standing next to a running air handler that is roughly the size of a minivan the sc is able to wipe out a good portion of the noise to make the level comfortable the qc wiped out the sound of the air handler completely to the point that it was difficult to tell if it was even turned onbr br i was interested in the linx audio aspect of the sc phones and at first i was very disappointed the high range is somewhat dampened s sometimes sounding like ph however the mid and low ranges are solid and are very rich whereas bose sounds good but has remarkably less depth the qc phones are primarily noise canceling phones and sound quality is secondary to that the sc headset achieves a better balance of sound to noise cancelingbr br once very distinct advantage that the sc headset has is that the phones will work without power though noise canceling does not work in that case the qc requires a working battery and must be turned on to work at allbr br right out of the box my sc phones were defective i contacted able planet hoping i could get some advice on how to adjust them but instead i got an rma number less than weeks later i had a new working pair in my hands that work much better than the initial pair customer service at able planet is very responsive professional and courteous with the lifetime warranty on their headphones bose cannot answer with their year warrantybr br which pair to buy is a matter of preference and intended use if the intended primary use is noise cancellation and comfort bose is the right choice for listening to music with the ability to engage noise canceling when needed able planet is a better choice considering the year bose warranty against an able planet lifetime warranty though is hard to ignorebr br as i use my phones for listening to music more than anything else i use the able planet headset as my primary headset and i keep my bose headset as a backup,3908

"I'm normally an ear bud user since I've never been able to find an over the ear headset that was comfortable to wear for more than 10 minutes or so at a time. Well, I found one - these are undoubtable the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. Just a dream to wear even for extended periods of time. Light, cushy, just right. And they look so elegant - a nice change from the sparse industrial look that electronics often have.<br /><br />Construction quality seems very good, especially the cord (a common point of failure for me with any type of earphones). It comes with the regular and mini size plugs.<br /><br />The sound quality is absolutly top-notch. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't throw out the phrases and jargon I typically read in audio discussion boards and magazines (well, I can throw them out, but not with any semblance of knowing what I'm taking about). So suffice it to say that I can't imagine anyone not being very pleased with the quality of sound using these and a MP3 player or an iPad (the two devices I've used with them so far). I've been absolutely amazed at how great these sound.<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of sound isolation. Outside sounds can easily be heard. Sometimes that's good, but most of the time I prefer to be isolated from whatever else is playing in the house. I'm finding I reach for these more often when I'm in a quiet environment, and use ear buds when there's a lot of noise about (with me defining noise as any type of music I don't care for).<br /><br />With the caveat of the lack of sound blocking, these should absolutely be on your short list if you're looking for a comfortable, great sounding pair of earphones.",4.0,im normally an ear bud user since ive never been able to find an over the ear headset that was comfortable to wear for more than minutes or so at a time well i found one these are undoubtable the most comfortable headphones ive ever used just a dream to wear even for extended periods of time light cushy just right and they look so elegant a nice change from the sparse industrial look that electronics often havebr br construction quality seems very good especially the cord a common point of failure for me with any type of earphones it comes with the regular and mini size plugsbr br the sound quality is absolutly topnotch im not an audiophile so i cant throw out the phrases and jargon i typically read in audio discussion boards and magazines well i can throw them out but not with any semblance of knowing what im taking about so suffice it to say that i cant imagine anyone not being very pleased with the quality of sound using these and a mp player or an ipad the two devices ive used with them so far ive been absolutely amazed at how great these soundbr br my only complaint is the lack of sound isolation outside sounds can easily be heard sometimes thats good but most of the time i prefer to be isolated from whatever else is playing in the house im finding i reach for these more often when im in a quiet environment and use ear buds when theres a lot of noise about with me defining noise as any type of music i dont care forbr br with the caveat of the lack of sound blocking these should absolutely be on your short list if youre looking for a comfortable great sounding pair of earphones,1608

"I am an audiophile but I always take into account the nature of the product that I am looking at or listening to. One cannot possibly expect a $99 portable bluetooth speaker to have legitimate audiophile sound. In this case, we're talking about the Creative Sound Blaster Roar. And that assertion is not in any way a knock on this product. I bought one a few days ago and I like it and am quite happy with the purchase for a variety of reasons. The main reason I like it is because the sound it produces is GOOD. That sound is not great nor is it bad. Perhaps the worst credible thing you might say about the sound is simply that it is FINE. When I consider the size of the unit (and the size of the very small speakers it contains) and the cost, I judge the sound to be GOOD. You are not going to get Martin Logan or Definitive Technology sound out of the Roar, plain and simple. Nor will you get super sound out of any of the other competitive products such as the Bose or JBL, etc. I think they all produce generally good sound for the money. The best and smartest thing a buyer can do is perhaps go to<br />Best Buy or any of the other retailers who carry such units and give them all a listen and look at the features they offer and then buy the one that meets your needs in terms of both sound quality and features. Having said that, for me the Roar has more features than any of the<br />competing units.  That is simply fact and not opinion. Most of the products that are in this category seem to be made well but in my opinion, the Roar seems to be made just a little sturdier. I haven't tested that notion by dropping my Roar  on the floor but in my hands it simply feels<br /> more robust. Back to the sound question.....since I seriously doubt that many users of portable bluetooth speakers plan on doing serious<br />listening that entails sitting in a quite room and doing nothing but listening intently to these little portable speakers, consider how they will actually be used.  Most people are playing them as background music while they are doing other things such as sitting on the beach or<br />cooking on the grill or in the kitchen, etc. Critical listening ain't happening here. So let's not talk about sound imaging or speaker spatiality etc. That said, for me, I don't like speakers that have a bass response that overwhelms everything else.  I want a more natural sound, One that is<br /><br /> more balanced to my ear. Because of that, I will gravitate towards something like the Roar. If you are one who wants more bass, then you will assuredly better like the sound of any Bose product as they have made a fortune producing bass heavy products for the last 50 years. Again, for me, the features are a big deal and the Roar excels inn that regard.  I won't waste your time talking about them as you can look such things up just as easily.  And price is a big deal to me.  The Roar 1 can be had for $99 now.... so I bought one. The Bose is $299 the last time I checked,...three times the cost of the Roar. So simply put, I loved the price of the Roar, the feature list is unmatched, it feels like military grade construction and lastly, I thought the sound was GOOD. That's why I bought it.",4.0,i am an audiophile but i always take into account the nature of the product that i am looking at or listening to one cannot possibly expect a portable bluetooth speaker to have legitimate audiophile sound in this case were talking about the creative sound blaster roar and that assertion is not in any way a knock on this product i bought one a few days ago and i like it and am quite happy with the purchase for a variety of reasons the main reason i like it is because the sound it produces is good that sound is not great nor is it bad perhaps the worst credible thing you might say about the sound is simply that it is fine when i consider the size of the unit and the size of the very small speakers it contains and the cost i judge the sound to be good you are not going to get martin logan or definitive technology sound out of the roar plain and simple nor will you get super sound out of any of the other competitive products such as the bose or jbl etc i think they all produce generally good sound for the money the best and smartest thing a buyer can do is perhaps go tobr best buy or any of the other retailers who carry such units and give them all a listen and look at the features they offer and then buy the one that meets your needs in terms of both sound quality and features having said that for me the roar has more features than any of thebr competing units that is simply fact and not opinion most of the products that are in this category seem to be made well but in my opinion the roar seems to be made just a little sturdier i havent tested that notion by dropping my roar on the floor but in my hands it simply feelsbr more robust back to the sound questionsince i seriously doubt that many users of portable bluetooth speakers plan on doing seriousbr listening that entails sitting in a quite room and doing nothing but listening intently to these little portable speakers consider how they will actually be used most people are playing them as background music while they are doing other things such as sitting on the beach orbr cooking on the grill or in the kitchen etc critical listening aint happening here so lets not talk about sound imaging or speaker spatiality etc that said for me i dont like speakers that have a bass response that overwhelms everything else i want a more natural sound one that isbr br more balanced to my ear because of that i will gravitate towards something like the roar if you are one who wants more bass then you will assuredly better like the sound of any bose product as they have made a fortune producing bass heavy products for the last years again for me the features are a big deal and the roar excels inn that regard i wont waste your time talking about them as you can look such things up just as easily and price is a big deal to me the roar can be had for now so i bought one the bose is the last time i checkedthree times the cost of the roar so simply put i loved the price of the roar the feature list is unmatched it feels like military grade construction and lastly i thought the sound was good thats why i bought it,3095

"Since there have only been a couple of reviews written about this product, I figured that a bit more information would be helpful for anyone looking to purchase this 20' telescoping mast from Channel Master.<br /><br />First of all, I have to take issue with the reviewer who complained that this mast wasn't sturdy or thick enough for his installation, which happened to include a wind turbine. This is NOT A TOWER. IT IS AN ANTENNA MAST!!! It's only intended use is for mounting external antennas. Period. Specifically, they are manufactured to support Channel Master's wide line of outdoor TV antenna products. It should work fine for most other brands of TV antennas as well and can probably support other relatively lightweight items (i.e. home weather stations, small ham radio or CB antennas). It is NOT intended to be used for heavy loads, such as wind turbines. For the price they are charging, what do you expect though? A ""real"" telescoping tower for applications like wind power will cost you thousands of dollars. Free standing towers made of high-strength tubular steel is what's required for heavy loads, and they must be anchored in a concrete base. Anything less than that and you are putting their entire structure, as well as whatever building you mount it to, in jeopardy. Not to mention the fact that you are likely in serious violation of local zoning ordinances. This item is for TV antennas, and does an admirable job of it.<br /><br />I recently installed one of these units at a commercial location that had absolutely no reliable reception on any channels. A small gust of wind would knock out reception completely, and the high-gain Yagi TV antenna that had been installed was quite expensive and on a 10' mast above the structure. It even had a preamp and rotor for fine tuning. For the new installation, I used the Channel Master CM 1820 mast in combination with a Winegard AP8275 Chromstar 2000 Preamplifier and a Winegard HD8200U Platinum HD VHF/UHF Antenna. I had gone with some other brands in the past that had let me down, so I wanted to see if using the Winegard equipment made any kind of difference.<br /><br />Despite the new and old antennas only being about 20' away from each other, the Channel Master/Winegard installation was like going from night to day for pulling in TV signals. Without using a rotor or doing any type of fine tuning (I had a good idea of where the antenna should be pointed, but that's it) the customer's reception has been rock solid. It pulls in both HDTV and low power NTSC translator signals on both UHF and VHF-HI. I have the tower itself extended about 15' with a total of four wall mount brackets bracing it against a wall for stability. I've never needed to use the guy wires. The HD8200U is one of the largest VHF/UHF TV antennas available in North America. So, if it can support this model, it can probably support just about any other TV antenna you can attach to it. Wind speeds at the location gust up to about 35 mph, which has never had a noticeable effect on the signal.<br /><br />About the only downside I can report on this particular product is the lack of adequate documentation and the way it is shipped. Basically, you get a giant 10' metal pipe in the mail/UPS with a shipping label on it and supporting hardware taped to one end. What little documentation there is, is rolled up inside the mast itself. One other thing that bugs me about manufacturers these days is the lack of part numbers (or even names, sometimes) included in the documentation. If you need to order a spare part, you can't ask for a specific part # and no specs are given so that you can look for parts locally. Call it a pet peeve, but it will cost the manufacturer one star in this case.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the customer was extremely satisfied with the installation and quality of the signal(s). It is actually being used for a mission-critical commercial application that requires 24/7/365 reception of digital signals. The mast, paired with the right antenna, amplifier, RG-6, weatherproofing and a professional (or at least professional-like) installation should assure you the best results possible under the circumstances. Even in an area where little to no reception should be possible, the mast helped give us the edge we needed to get the job done right for the customer the first time. HDTV reception is far superior to what I have seen on the local cable TV system for the same channels. For what this mast costs compared to the slightly cheaper ones you will find at local hardware stores, I'd say it's a pretty hard deal to beat.<br /><br />One last detail: Please note that this mast does NOT come with all of the guy wire hardware you will need if you intend to secure it via that method. The mast itself is ""guy wire ready"", but no actual guy wire or anchoring (to the structure) hardware is included. Fortunately, this hardware is pretty universally available. The cost is not trivial for heavy gauge installations, but the parts should be readily available online or locally at most hardware stores.",4.0,since there have only been a couple of reviews written

However it does have one of the few flash units on a point and shoot that is quite good. It doesn't blow out photos and gives great color rendering in indoor conditions.

"this film is good, bringing new life to my old Polaroid Sun 660 camera. The pics have the same nostalgic Polaroid look to them. I did discover that the flash still works on the old camera, which I was worried about after years in storage. I have used Impossible film before, though only with my Spectra, SX70, and One Step.

"I have a Nuvi 360. It came with a suction cup windshield mount. It also came with a steel disk with double sticky adhesive on the back. I was supposed to mount this disk somewhere on my dashboard, then use the suction cup to attach the mount. I didn't want to use the suction mount directly onto the windshield because 1) it telegraphs the presence of an expensive GPS unit, 2) it's illegal in California to attach anything to the windshield and 3) I don't think the suction cup would last very long.<br /><br />Then there's the disk with the very permanent double sticky tape. The problem with almost all cars these days is there really isn't anywhere to attach the disk discreetly. Every square inch is taken with existing stuff. And who wants an ugly disk glued to the dash anyway? And what if I want to use the GPS in other vehicles? More disks?<br /><br />So I settled on this ""beanbag"" mount with the ball mount arm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, before the beanbag friction mount arrived, I was flexing the arm in the suction cup mount and noticed the suction cup's mounting bracket had already broken. I had never even attached it to anything! The mount is beautifully engineered and built...except for one area where the arm's hinge pin attaches to the suction cup's plastic hinge loops. The loops are too thin and fragile. The loops cracked and broke with hardly any hinging at all.<br /><br />So now I have a quite useless suction mount but a very functional ball arm. What to do?<br /><br />I drove the hinge pin out of the ball arm. Then I took two small 1"" x 1"" steel angle brackets and attached them to the ball arm with a 2"" long, 8-32 threaded machine screw and an 8-32 wingnut. This created two ""feet"" for the ball arm. Then I epoxied the two bracket ""feet"" to the fabric (upper) side of an old 1/4"" thick mousepad. Ta da. A friction pad for pennies with a ball arm attached.<br /><br />Works great. Cost was virtually nothing. Doesn't slide on either of the two dashboards I've tried it on. The mousepad is flexible and conforms easily to the curving shape of the various dashboards. It doesn't weigh much but the thick mousepad has enough heft to plant the getup nicely. The grippy rubber side of the mousepad adheres nicely to the dash. Yet I can pull it down to the floor quickly and reposition it easily.<br /><br />I wish I'd thought of this BEFORE I ordered this ""official"" friction mount to the tune of a couple of twenties.",4.0,i have a nuvi it came with a suction cup windshield mount it also came with a steel disk with double sticky adhesive on the back i was supposed to mount this disk somewhere on my dashboard then use the suction cup to attach the mount i didnt want to use the suction mount directly onto the windshield because it telegraphs the presence of an expensive gps unit its illegal in california to attach anything to the windshield and i dont think the suction cup would last very longbr br then theres the disk with the very permanent double sticky tape the problem with almost all cars these days is there really isnt anywhere to attach the disk discreetly every square inch is taken with existing stuff and who wants an ugly disk glued to the dash anyway and what if i want to use the gps in other vehicles more disksbr br so i settled on this beanbag mount with the ball mount armbr br unfortunately before the beanbag friction mount arrived i was flexing the arm in the suction cup mount and noticed the suction cups mounting bracket had already broken i had never even attached it to anything the mount is beautifully engineered and builtexcept for one area where the arms hinge pin attaches to the suction cups plastic hinge loops the loops are too thin and fragile the loops cracked and broke with hardly any hinging at allbr br so now i have a quite useless suction mount but a very functional ball arm what to dobr br i drove the hinge pin out of the ball arm then i took two small x steel angle brackets and attached them to the ball arm with a long threaded machine screw and an wingnut this created two feet for the ball arm then i epoxied the two bracket feet to the fabric upper side of an old thick mousepad ta da a friction pad for pennies with a ball arm attachedbr br works great cost was virtually nothing doesnt slide on either of the two dashboards ive tried it on the mousepad is flexible and conforms easily to the curving shape of the various dashboards it doesnt weigh much but the thick mousepad has enough heft to plant the getup nicely the grippy rubber side of the mousepad adheres nicely to the dash yet i can pull it down to the floor quickly and reposition it easilybr br i wish id thought of this before i ordered this official friction mount to the tune of a couple of twenties,2304
"I like the camera clip overall, it seems to be very well made and holds the camera securely, but there are several things that would make it so much better. 1. The space between the screws should be a bit wider. It is very difficult to attach it to a backpack strap as most straps are too wide. 2. It would be great if a hex hole was included in the thumb screws. It is very difficult to tighten the thumb screws. 3. Lack of coin slot on the screw that attaches the plate to the camera is disappointing. 4. The plate that attaches to the camera is Arca-Swiss compatible but will not work with most tripods.

"ok, so the installation was quite easy, and the provided directions do not give you specifics, nor do 3 of the 4 You Tube links provided, work.  All the components were provided, except the 3M sticky tape template on step 9 that allows you attach to your dash/etc.  I ordered the window suction cup separately, (Amazon) and it should be received Oct 19, 2021.<br /><br />That said, you can see in the first 5 pictures that I started with a Voyager brand fake camera cover on my Outback trailer, and as it turns out the wiring for a camera was already wired direct into the trailer running lights.  Check the polarity of your wires with a voltmeter.<br /><br />So I removed the cover plate, scraped off the old silicone, used stainless screws/washers to install the metal camera holder, directly onto the Voyager plastic plate.  I drilled an additional 4 small holes in the plate, and also put a rubber grommet in the center hole to run the cable through. I used liquid electrical tape to add additional moisture protection at the T terminals. Then waterproof silicone to seal it all up.<br /><br />The camera gauge wires are smaller than the trailer wiring, I believe they are 18 or 20 awg whereas the trailer is 16awg, so not a direct match.  Does not seem to be a big deal so far, but recommend Amtifo use a larger gauge to match typical US wiring systems.  I tested the system for connectivity before all wiring was completed, and it (pairing) did not go as smooth as I expected.  Numerous restarts and connection/pairing issues.<br /><br />The 6th picture is the final install - I used blue thread lock on the camera mount side screws because they would likely come loose at some point.  That again should be a recommendation in the instructions. The last picture was the first road trip, 60 mph, camera worked fine. However there is a greenish halo/haze at the bottom third of the screen, that I need to address with Evan at Amtifo customer service.  (He has responded to all 3 emails, timely)<br /><br />I have not tried the backup option yet, nor night driving, so will update accordingly later.  There was a final glitch after the road test - it was getting dark, I was backing the RV up, and could not see anything discernible.  Then the monitor went black after I pressed the on/off button, and when it came back on, I kept getting a blinking screen showing I needed an SD card.  Pretty random, eh?  I did not have a caed handy, so deferred to the next day. I could not even get to the startup screen, it just kept blinking.<br /><br />I informed Evan at Amtifo, and he asked what type vehicle I had (??) and what the voltage and current ""of the car"" was. Given the monitor and camera worked fine for 30 minutes on the test run, not sure why either question would be relevant to solving the ""blackout"".<br /><br />Day 2, found a card, installed it.  After running through the pairing steps twice again, including holding the monitor up close to the camera (used a 12v extension cord), I got them to pair and voila!! - a picture behind the RV!<br /><br />So apparently you have to have a card installed to make this all work, which is not stated in the instructions - or - there is an intermittent glitch in the monitor / camera pairing and the solution remains unknown.  At this point I am happy it works, the price point is pretty inexpensive for what you get, and there are a number of other brands that look identical to this unit, suggesting it is the same manufacturer in China but rebranded. They claim in the instruction manual, you can choose between a free 2nd camera, an SD card, or a cigarette lighter splitter, if you provide them a copy of your Amazon review - so here we are.<br /><br />I chose the camera, we shall see...I am also deferring purchase of a 7db extended antenna to attach to the camera and place on the RV roof, as I would first like to see if any reception issues occur on the next trip.  Some reviewers have noted they saw virtuallly no change in the video quality / reception.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Inexpensive solution to a trailering challenge (seeing behind and approaching sides)<br />- Easy install if you have at least basic DIY skills<br />- Quality of materials adequate for the purpose<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the screen buttons are not that responsive to finger touch, and I have concerns once the monitor is attached to the windshield suction cup - don't want to be fiddling with buttons to make them work when Im zipping down the highway with a load.<br />- The camera antenna provided is very short, and does not clear the roof of the RV (though they suggest to mount it up high or on the roof or over the center parking lights).  But who wants to drill more holes in their RV, or lose the center light?  Just provide an 8"" antenna - connectivity problem solved at close to zero added cost.<br />- the links in the instruction manual, pg 4 of the front side, clearly do not work, and you will get that msg from You Tube ""Video not, or no longer, available"".

"Three kids microscopes compared.<br /><br />1)  AmScope 120X-1200X 52-pcs Kids Beginner Microscope<br />2)  Swift Compound Monocular Microscope 60X-200X<br />3)  EMARTH Microscope for Kids Beginners Children Student, 40X- 1000X<br /><br />Note:  The prices of these microscopes vary from time to time.  When I purchased them they were all within about a $20 price range.<br /><br />Amscope:<br />This microscope is basically useless.  The optics are terrible.  Even on the lowest magnification level nothing interesting can be distinguished.  At the highest mag you will be lucky if you can even find the ""focal"" plane.<br /><br />It also lacks a ""light from above"".  That would be a useful feature for an inquisitive child.<br /><br />It does have two things going for it:  It comes with a case, and the frame of the microscope is made of metal.  Both of the other two microscopes have plastic frames and neither comes with a case.  It is also the cheapest of the three, but saving $20 and getting a worthless microscope doesn't really seem like a great deal.<br /><br />Swift:<br />Nice bright and large field of view.  Best of the three in these regards.  But the magnifications does not go that high.  Smaller details are visible on the EMARTH.  Theoretically they would be visible on the AmScope if the image quality was anything better than terrible.<br /><br />Lights both above and below the sample.  Intensities are independently adjustable (nice).<br /><br />The stage on this scope is more difficult to adjust.  Get the image in focus and let go of the knob and the stage ""relaxes"" to a new position, and the image goes out of focus.  A bit of tweaking will get a focused image, but shouldn't be necessary, and may frustrate a child.<br /><br />I am unsure of the total magnifications of the Swift.  The objectives are labeled 60X, 120X, and 200X.  Actual magnifications seem higher, although not nearly as high as the other two.<br /><br />I can see an argument being made that this microscope is the best of the three.because of the larger and brighter field of view, but the highest magnification level on the Swift is not enough.<br /><br />Frame is plastic.  No case.<br /><br />EMARTH:<br />Reasonably bright images.  Decent sized field of view.  The objective lens housings are made of metal - the other two have plastic lens housings.  This microscope also come with two eye pieces, one 10X and the other 25X.  Very quick to swap them for a different view.<br /><br />Switch for (1) Light from below, (2) Light from above, (3) Both.  Intensity is adjustable, but not independently Above/Below.<br /><br />Frame is plastic.  No case.  Instructions say to ""Use the dust cover provided by the microscope manufacturer...."" to protect the eye piece, but no dust cover was included.<br /><br />This is the best of the three.

"This is a Change from my One Star review earlier. I have a brand new Mac Mini with Sierra came on it, and it would not work. There were no instructions in the box. So I had to try several things and finally got it to work. I went to Logitech and downloaded the software available and installed them. Then I went to the Apple App store and put in Logitech and chose the Logitech Cam app and installed it too. Then I had to click on that one and it runs in the background and has a couple things you can change. I also opened the Gaming program too with more changes you can made in brightness, white balance and so on. (I am not using it for Gaming, just recording things for Youtube and my business.) You also have to go into SOUND and choose the webcam speakers. Then I used the Zoom Program (zoom.us) in order to record myself on this!  I had to go into settings there too... by Video arrow pointing up, and choose the 920 Webcam again.) When you do get it to work, it is very good quality. It just takes effort in Sierra.

Read what is compatible with carefully i’m an analog person in a digital world. I put in the search bar cable for iPad Pro this came up. I read it I thought I understood what I was buying but obviously not.

"A very good screen protector and very easy to install. a cleaner cloth is enclosed and a stiff card to rub out air bubbles. Application is quick if lyou have steady hands to position screen, but it has instruction for making it easier.

"Since the [[ASIN:B009S4FMB6 Jabra SUPREME Driver's Edition Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Silver]] comes with a headband, I tend to use it with the headband.  Unfortunately, my hair is thinning because I lose some each time I remove the headset.  Regardless, this bluetooth is extremely easy to synch with my Droid and it's recognized each and every time I turn on the Bluetooth in the car.  I wear this only for driving and I don't care that passersby give me funny looks, it works great.  The earpiece is larger than most contemporary bluetooth devices, but it's cushiony and comfortable for long drives.  The microphone is sensitive and responsive.  I haven't had a complaint yet with any call.  Slipping the earphone onto the headband is a simple task, and I find that I'm wearing it 90% of the time, preferring that to the ear wire and no band.  My main criticism other than the hair pulling of this design is that it takes some getting used to to operate the touch controls as well as turn the device on and off.  When off of the band, it's an easy feat, but no so when it's attached and you can't bend the microphone down completely.  Since the battery is really long lasting, it hasn't run out of power yet in the middle of a call.  Because you have options for charging this set, you're a step ahead, and with an adjustable headband, it fits most head sizes.  It's a good set.",4.0,since the asinbsfmb jabra supreme drivers edition bluetooth headset retail packaging blacksilver comes with a headband i tend to use it with the headband unfortunately my hair is thinning because i lose some each time i remove the headset regardless this bluetooth is extremely easy to synch with my droid and its recognized each and every time i turn on the bluetooth in the car i wear this only for driving and i dont care that passersby give me funny looks it works great the earpiece is larger than most contemporary bluetooth devices but its cushiony and comfortable for long drives the microphone is sensitive and responsive i havent had a complaint yet with any call slipping the earphone onto the headband is a simple task and i find that im wearing it of the time preferring that to the ear wire and no band my main criticism other than the hair pulling of this design is that it takes some getting used to to operate the touch controls as well as turn the device on and off when off of the band its an easy feat but no so when its attached and you cant bend the microphone down completely since the battery is really long lasting it hasnt run out of power yet in the middle of a call because you have options for charging this set youre a step ahead and with an adjustable headband it fits most head sizes its a good set,1330

It is a rather thin Neoprene which will keep my wife's Surface Pro Scratch free but not completely protected from a drop.  She plans on putting it into her backpack, so with both she is pretty well protected.  It fits easily over both her Surface Pro with keyboard and standing case.  The dual zippers zip smoothly.

"I like that the tripod completely folds into the bottom of the case. The case looks like it was well-constructed. It has pockets on both sides, and inside it has two padded dividers for putting in a camera and other small items such as lenses, extra camera batteries, small charger, lens cleaning accessories and filters.  This is not a large case by any means but for quick set up shoot, it is sufficient. I was able to put in a small video camera, two extra lenses and two extra batteries easily without using the outside pockets. It’s worth mentioning that this case doesn't have a lot of padding so you would want to be careful on how much you pack into it.<br /><br />The tripod is certainly sturdy and lightweight but fully extended it is about only about 55 inches. I wish this should have been at least 10 inches higher.

"We’ve had the Arlo Security System for about a week.  Installation was quick and easy.  I was able to connect the cameras to my home’s wi-fi and have the cameras up and running in under 15 minutes.  The cameras monitoring our garage doors and inside our home are working well.  However finding a good location for the camera monitoring our front door has been a challenge.  Because of the design of our front entrance, the only place we can install the camera is facing the walkway and stairs leading up to our front door.  Unfortunately because the cameras rely on thermal detection, a person coming directly towards the cameras is more difficult to detect. As a result, by the time the camera begins to record a delivery person, for example, the camera is only able to capture the individual departing (his or her back).  The person walking up to the front door and delivering the package is never captured on video.  We have tried changing the camera's sensitivity settings but that has not helped much.  Hopefully we will find a good compromise for the front door camera otherwise we will have to find another product that works better.",4.0,weve had the arlo security system for about a week installation was quick and easy i was able to connect the cameras to my homes wifi and have the cameras up and running in under minutes the cameras monitoring our garage doors and inside our home are working well however finding a good location for the camera monitoring our front door has been a challenge because of the design of our front entrance the only place we can install the camera is facing the walkway and stairs leading up to our front door unfortunately because the cameras rely on thermal detection a person coming directly towards the cameras is more difficult to detect as a result by the time the camera begins to record a delivery person for example the camera is only able to capture the individual departing his or her back the person walking up to the front door and delivering the package is never captured on video we have tried changing the cameras sensitivity settings but that has not helped much hopefully we will find a good compromise for the front door camera otherwise we will have to find another product that works better,1106

"These headphones sound very nice (seems like they don't quite live up to my Image S4s, but close, and they're not broken in yet). The Bluetooth signal has been plenty strong for my needs, and I've had no issue pairing them with my Mac or Android devices.<br /><br />My only complaint is the length of the cable between the headphones. I do not have a small head or neck, but with the cable in front of my neck, it reaches down to my upper-chest. If I'm wearing a hoodie or any shirt that isn't just smooth where the cable lies, it will catch on the shirt/jacket and push the headphones up off the top of my ears. I can't wear the wire behind my neck at all, because every time I look up or even come up from looking down, the cable presses on my neck enough to push the headphones up off the top of my ears.<br /><br />If the cable were much shorter, it would not press against the back of my neck, and it would not reach down to my chest, which would avoid the issues above.

"Not bad. I just wanted something that would alert me at night if someone were to open my front door. This would definitely wake me up. This in no way is going to replace a security system, but at this price it is not bad as a precaution. I found 2 minor cons. 1) The type of battery used is a bit expensive to replace. I wish they would have just used a AA or AAA. 2) The chime feature is a little near useless. It works and will definitely alert you that the door has opened, but it is really really loud. I guess this thing only has one volume setting and they just threw the chime feature in as an after thought.

"This is great for commuters and college students. It isn't noice canceling in the traditional sense, but allows some background Boise in so you can be aware of your surroundings. For example, you will be able to clearly able to hear people calling you right next to you, cars and trains approaching. In my opinion, these are the best kind since you get the sound quality you want from your music, bust still not compromise on safety, especially for those that may not be very aware of their surroundings. As with any cuffed headsets, your ears will get a bit sweaty on a hot day. This has a microphone for calls, and can be used wired or wireless.

"So over all I think I like this case. The pen seems to charge with no problems and because the rubber outer shell fits snugly over the bottom and top pieces it seems secure. My one issue with it at the moment is that the opening designed to accommodating the screen on off button on top is to small. I was able, with my Dremel tool, to make the hole larger. I think if you didn’t have a way to make the space larger like files, sand paper or a dremel you would be screwed. You’re not able to turn the iPad on and off with out the adjustment.<br /><br />A plus is that if you like having a screen protector on your iPad like I do.

"Right out of the box the first thing I thought was &#34;Simplicity!&#34; That's a very good thing. Instructions: simple. Headphones themselves: simple. Earpieces: simple. Bose Connect app: simple. Bluetooth pairing: simple. It has a very nice zippered case to carry what few simple items come with it,  the device and the charging cord. Really, once you figure out what size earpiece you need, I see no need to carry the others. Now,  fit and comfortability. These earpieces are SO comfortable, soft, and easy to fit into the ear. The medium size that where installed out of the box fit me perfectly. The power button on top of the right side was very easy to feel and operate. The right side of the cord houses the function button piece and microphone for calls. Unlike some wireless headphones I've tried, this function piece is very light and doesn't feel &#34;weighty&#34; on that side at all. The sound is very good. When the music goes silent, I did hear a very slight buzzing in the background, but it didn't really detract when listening. The only drawbacks were that the app did not have an equalizer function to adjust the tone. That's a pretty big deal for me, but I have to tell you, I LOVE these headphones!<br /><br />I'll give them four stars instead of five, only for the lack of eq function.",4.0,right out of the box the first thing i thought was simplicity thats a very good thing instructions simple headphones themselves simple earpieces simple bose connect app simple bluetooth pairing simple it has a very nice zippered case to carry what few simple items come with it the device and the charging cord really once you figure out what size earpiece you need i see no need to carry the others now fit and comfortability these earpieces are so comfortable soft and easy to fit into the ear the medium size that where installed out of the box fit me perfectly the power button on top of the right side was very easy to feel and operate the right side of the cord houses the function button piece and microphone for calls unlike some wireless headphones ive tried this function piece is very light and doesnt feel weighty on that side at all the sound is very good when the music goes silent i did hear a very slight buzzing in the background but it didnt really detract when listening the only drawbacks were that the app did not have an equalizer function to adjust the tone thats a pretty big deal for me but i have to tell you i love these headphonesbr br ill give them four stars instead of five only for the lack of eq function,1237
Just finished a long trip and it handled everything very well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- quality<br />- zoom and lens<br />- fits in my pocket<br />- ability to download to phone over Wifi<br /><br />Cons:<br />- occasionally changed some random setting by accident and had to figure out how to undo. This was annoying<br />- app is a bit clumsy and old school and disallows download to a cloud drive or options. For example I couldn’t save video because stupid apple doesn’t support the format I chose. I would have liked to backup to cloud. This made me have to keep my videos on the memory card but selection isn’t easy in the app so I ended up just keeping everything.<br /><br />Overall in spite of the cons above it worked really well and the features I bought it for out valued the negatives.

"This is a work of art, and the epitome of what a gaming pad should be.  I can use the thumbstick as WASD movements while I quickly tap on whatever buttons I need.  Its very comfortable and I can play on it for up to 12 hours at a time without any discomfort.

"For the record: I hate this trend in mobile phones to push us away from a standard 3.5mm jack. I tried to hold onto a phone that had one for as long as I could, but when my Galaxy S10 had to go, I needed an adapter. I love using my high end studio IEMs for music instead of bluetooth or cheap USB-C headphones, and sometimes if my bluetooth earpiece isn't charged, I want to grab my laptop headphones with their in-line mic to do handsfree calls.<br />Well, I'm happy to say at least I can use this for music with my IEMs and other wired headphones. But I think the jack might be TRS and not TRRS. That means it is missing the extra pin to support the microphone if your headphones have one.<br />In a nutshell, this will turn a pair of regular stereo (no mic) headphones into a USBC compatible one, but it still isn't as good as a native 3.5mm jack.

"As we got this in a four pack, everyone in the family who had devices with screens immediately got one to put to use. Everyone agreed that this screen cleaner did an excellent job on small screens, like phones and tablets. I found that it wasn't as good on larger screens though. On 1920x1080 full size desktop screens, the cleaner was more awkward to use and  was more prone to streaking and such. One nice thing though is that the spray had no chemical smell. In fact, it didn't have any discernible odor at all. Our techie teen figured out how to get the bottle out so it can be refilled when necessary. I did have a little trouble figuring out how the stand work and I wondered why a screen cleaner needed an attached stand. As it turns out, I'm glad it has one. It works very nicely for my 10"" tablet. The family consensus was to give this product a 4 star rating because it worked so well on small screens and because the stand actually turned out to be useful. The fact that it was less effective on larger screens and that it is a bit pricey are the reasons it didn't get a full 5 stars. Our family liked this screen cleaner.

"This is a standard, run of the mill USB external drive. It's compact (measures about 3 inches wide, 5 inches long and roughly one-half inch thick). It's powered by the USB port, and includes a short (8 inch) cable. It's a nice-looking device - glossy black, and feels substantial.<br /><br />The biggest difference I've seen is that it does not come loaded with any software. That's a huge plus in my book - I returned a Toshiba drive since it really put up a fight when I tried to bypass loading its software. My usual brand (Seagate) is nicer in that it allows you to bypass the software install, but the Maxell approach is the best: don't have any to begin with! The software that comes with these drives is, at best, superfluous. At worse, it is a source of interference/conflict with other software. So Maxell gets a big thumbs up for taking the no software approach.<br /><br />Speed is decent. I didn't notice any measurable difference between it and a similar Seagate drive.<br /><br />My dislikes are the short cord. While it may be fine for a laptop, it's cumbersome for a desktop. A 12 to 18 inch cord would have been welcomed.<br /><br />My concern is regarding support. Although I had zero problems installing and using this, I went to the Maxell site to see how their support was. I couldn't even find this product listed - they have a lot of products, but no category for external hard drives. A search of the model number on their site produced no hits.<br /><br />I imagine this is a new market for Maxell, and they are putting their name on a drive produced by someone else (total guess on my part). In any case, not even having the product listed on their website is concerning to me should I have the need for support in the future.<br /><br />[UPDATE DEC 2011: Hard drives are now listed on the support section of the Maxell site, so support may no longer be an issue of concern.]<br /><br />But, other than the short cord, I've had no problems and would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to avoid fighting with their external drive when it insists on loading unnecessary software.",4.0,this is a standard run of the mill usb external drive its compact measures about inches wide inches long and roughly onehalf inch thick its powered by the usb port and includes a short inch cable its a nicelooking device glossy black and feels substantialbr br the biggest difference ive seen is that it does not come loaded with any software thats a huge plus in my book i returned a toshiba drive since it really put up a fight when i tried to bypass loading its software my usual brand seagate is nicer in that it allows you to bypass the software install but the maxell approach is the best dont have any to begin with the software that comes with these drives is at best superfluous at worse it is a source of interferenceconflict with other software so maxell gets a big thumbs up for taking the no software approachbr br speed is decent i didnt notice any measurable difference between it and a similar seagate drivebr br my dislikes are the short cord while it may be fine for a laptop its cumbersome for a desktop a to inch cord would have been welcomedbr br my concern is regarding support although i had zero problems installing and using this i went to the maxell site to see how their support was i couldnt even find this product listed they have a lot of products but no category for external hard drives a search of the model number on their site produced no hitsbr br i imagine this is a new market for maxell and they are putting their name on a drive produced by someone else total guess on my part in any case not even having the product listed on their website is concerning to me should i have the need for support in the futurebr br update dec hard drives are now listed on the support section of the maxell site so support may no longer be an issue of concernbr br but other than the short cord ive had no problems and would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to avoid fighting with their external drive when it insists on loading unnecessary software,1984

"I purchased this to copy old VHS tapes to DVDs. It was easy to setup and operate. If your VHS tapes are all 2 hr SP (Standard Play) you should have no problems. I was able to successfully copy over 50 VHS tapes that were 20+ years old. At the recommendation of others, I used these DVD-R disk without a single issue.<br />[[ASIN:B007BL1R9O CMC Pro - Powered by TY Technology Premium Blank DVD - 8x 4.7GB DVD-R Silver Thermal in Cake Box - 100 Pack]]<br /><br />I did run into problems when changing the recording mode from SP to LP and SP to EP. The resulting DVDs ended up with a distorted aspect ratio (which is why I'm deducting 1 star). I ended up recording the 2+ hr VHS tapes onto multiple DVDs.<br /><br />I was only able to eject VHS tapes using the remote by hitting the VCR button followed by the eject button. Doing the same on the recorder would only open/close the DVD tray.<br /><br />Another minor problem that I encountered was with a tape that had a copy-once broadcast program (some movie) on it that had been recorded over with family events. The family events were taped over multiple days and had a few seconds of the copy-once movie in between. The Funai Recorded would stop dubbing any time the copy protected scenes were detected. This was a minor annoyance that I thankfully only had to deal with twice.<br /><br />The only other issue I had was with a couple VHS tapes that were recorded in Hi-Fi stereo. When playing these tapes there was no sound coming through the TV. If this happens, you need to<br />1. Have the VHS tape playing then<br />2. Press the DVD button on the remote then<br />3. Press the Audio button on the remote to change the sound to MONO. You should hear sound now.<br />Now you can stop the VHS tape and rewind it, then start the dubbing process. The sound will now be recorded on the DVD. Note that the Funai Recorded will not remember this setting. The next time you put in a VHS tape you will need to repeat these steps if necessary.<br /><br />Steps Required to Copy a VHS Tape to DVD (assuming VHS is 2 hrs long)<br />1. Insert VHS tape and a blank DVD-R disk. The order does not matter.<br />2. Play the VHS tape to check for audio. Stop or pause the tape a few seconds before the point you want to record.<br />3. Press the red D.Dubbing button on the remote to start the VHS to DVD copy process.<br />4. Press the Stop button when you are done recording or wait for the Funai Recorded to automatically stop. Every time you start and stop the dubbing process you create a separate title menu on the DVD. This is nice if you have the patience to separate out different events recorded on the same VHS tape.<br />5. (Optional) After dubbing, press Setup on the remote and give your DVD a title then press the Return button twice to get out of the Setup.<br />6. Go to Setup again and Finalize your DVD.

"I got this system to keep an eye on my carport, shop, and front porch, and have been very happy with it so far. The 8 channel system came with 4 cameras but I'm only using 3 for now, pending decision on location of the 4th.<br />The POE system was ultra simple & straightforward to install. Configuration was also easy, in spite of the poorly written and outdated instructions. The PDF QR image directs to an outdated app, but the QR on the DVR points to the correct one. I had difficulty getting the cameras to show up on their app. An email to customer service ultimately got me up & running, but only after the usual back-and-forth with multiple customer support personnel. The 2nd person that responded to my email acted like they had not even bothered to read my initial email, giving me ""help"" that was not applicable to my issue. This is when I found out about the outdated app. Once the correct one was installed, it was working except for 1 camera, which was working on the DVR display. They sent me a link to a firmware update, which took care of the issue. There is a button on the DVR setup menu that is supposed to check for an update. I had clicked this button a couple times over the course of setup & just general messing around, but it always reported that there was no update available, and I was running the current version. Apparently this feature does not work properly. I am initially giving 5-stars for motion detection, although I've yet to fine-tune it. The night vision lights attract bugs, moths, etc. so there is more perceived activity to the system. It doesn't seem like it would be possible to filter out this type of motion detection, so it is what it is.

The Panasonic RB-M500B Deep Base Head Phones are very well made with great battery life.  The battery lasted a lot longer then I expected per charge.  The sound quality is clear if not a little lower sometimes but the bass adjust button is amazing at bringing a full sounding bass while not taking away from quality and clarity.  The larger than normal ear pieces fit quite comfortably and do not push against the head too much at all.  While the buttons blend in seamlessly they are hard to navigate your fingers to operate while listening. Overall a great headset and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair for a reasonable price.,4.0,the panasonic rbmb deep base head phones are very well made with great battery life the battery lasted a lot longer then i expected per charge the sound quality is clear if not a little lower sometimes but the bass adjust button is amazing at bringing a full sounding bass while not taking away from quality and clarity the larger than normal ear pieces fit quite comfortably and do not push against the head too much at all while the buttons blend in seamlessly they are hard to navigate your fingers to operate while listening overall a great headset and i would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair for a reasonable price,636
"Got it to use for backing up laptop, phone, etc. , and archiving stuff that I PROBABLY won't need again but might. Works GREAT for those purposes and with 8 TB of capacity it will be a while before its filled up.  Quiet when in operation and worked fine with a windows laptop and an Android phone EXCEPT (reason for 4 stars)...<br /><br />If I plug the phone into the laptop's USB port, then I can transfer files to this drive (connected to another of the laptop's USB ports.  HOWEVER, if I try to connect the (Android) phone directly to one of the USB ports on the disk drive I get an error message ""USB Device setup failure"" and it won't install the phone for backup.

"I'm really enjoying this little tablet/laptop. I would have to say that it's more of a tablet than a laptop as the keyboard is not needed to use the machine. First off, the tablet portion, is extremely heavy especially for how small it is. I can't see myself holding this up for long periods of time. Also, the keyboard is extremely light and feels pretty cheap. Sometimes if you don't have the tablet at the right angle, it tips over backwards because the tablet is so much heavier than the keyboard.<br /><br />I do like the different ways that you can attach the keyboard to the tablet, and the different positions that allows you to use the laptop in, but I feel like that's just a plus and not something that is extremely important, at least for me.<br /><br />I also like that is windows based, giving you some more options for what you can do with it as opposed to apple or android machines, but I hate that it is windows 8. I do not like windows 8 at all, I find it confusing and not user friendly.<br /><br />This makes a great secondary laptop and would be wonderful for travel with it's compact size. It would probably be very useful for people who do some of their business outside of the office and need a small laptop to use as a backup.",4.0,im really enjoying this little tabletlaptop i would have to say that its more of a tablet than a laptop as the keyboard is not needed to use the machine first off the tablet portion is extremely heavy especially for how small it is i cant see myself holding this up for long periods of time also the keyboard is extremely light and feels pretty cheap sometimes if you dont have the tablet at the right angle it tips over backwards because the tablet is so much heavier than the keyboardbr br i do like the different ways that you can attach the keyboard to the tablet and the different positions that allows you to use the laptop in but i feel like thats just a plus and not something that is extremely important at least for mebr br i also like that is windows based giving you some more options for what you can do with it as opposed to apple or android machines but i hate that it is windows i do not like windows at all i find it confusing and not user friendlybr br this makes a great secondary laptop and would be wonderful for travel with its compact size it would probably be very useful for people who do some of their business outside of the office and need a small laptop to use as a backup,1201
"This is a great filter to improve your outdoor pictures.  The only problem, is that the Nikon lens cap that fits on my 18-70mm lens wont fit on with this filter in place.

"I got this in a military store because I am constantly traveling and wanted a lighter laptop to stay in touch. Startup and shutdown are quicker than on larger laptops. I'm glad there is more than enough hard drive storage but the included battery could be larger. The 3-cell is actually perfect for the form but it only lasts about 2.5 hours of heavy use. I ordered a 6-cell to become my primary battery but the back sticks out and ruins the smooth look of the form. Some people complained about the buttons being on opposite sides of the touchpad but it hasn't made any difference to the work I do since I use a mouse, which came with the computer. The only other drawback is the screen resolution. You have to be careful about loading any games that require a greater resolution than 1024 x 600. I have several favorites that can't be loaded on this. However, Corel WordPerfect Suite X3 and Microsoft Office 2007 loaded just fine. It also comes with InterVideo WinDVD but it is only a trial edition-it used to be free-so I downloaded iTunes. There isn't much bloatware so it didn't take long for me to get rid of what I didn't want. All in all, this is a great buy for a road warrior. If you think you'll be away from a wall socket longer than 2 hours, get the model with the 6-cell battery.",4.0,i got this in a military store because i am constantly traveling and wanted a lighter laptop to stay in touch startup and shutdown are quicker than on larger laptops im glad there is more than enough hard drive storage but the included battery could be larger the cell is actually perfect for the form but it only lasts about hours of heavy use i ordered a cell to become my primary battery but the back sticks out and ruins the smooth look of the form some people complained about the buttons being on opposite sides of the touchpad but it hasnt made any difference to the work i do since i use a mouse which came with the computer the only other drawback is the screen resolution you have to be careful about loading any games that require a greater resolution than x i have several favorites that cant be loaded on this however corel wordperfect suite x and microsoft office loaded just fine it also comes with intervideo windvd but it is only a trial editionit used to be freeso i downloaded itunes there isnt much bloatware so it didnt take long for me to get rid of what i didnt want all in all this is a great buy for a road warrior if you think youll be away from a wall socket longer than hours get the model with the cell battery,1239

I've had the camera for a month and I'm pretty impressed with the overall performance. It's definitely the most beautiful camera I've ever had amongst about a dozen models from Ricoh (Caplio R4, R5 and R6), Canon (SD200, SD650), Panasonic (FZ8, FZ28, FZ45), Sony (HX5). Build quality is very good. The menus are pretty intuitive. Handling is a breeze. The speed is good. Picture quality is very good most times as far as small sensors are concerned. Video is smooth. The filters are fun to use. Flash is excellent, open it when needed. Super macro is fantastic. Tele reach is impressive. Low light pics without flash are better than expected.

"I really like the design but it comes with some consideration. There wasn't much guidance on how to set this up so took me a while to figure out how to ''activate'' all the charging portals. There are two USB charging ports and two tri-prong regular outlets. I have a charging station that is usually plugged by 4-6 devices and it's always a mess. They didn't work perfectly for my need but these are sleek design, perfect for personal office organization. However, the charging cord is very thick and storage boxes are light, so you can easily tilt any of the parts and I needed my Echo to keep the portals stay. The storage box is enough to keep your keys and a few post-its which are very nice to hide your tiny junks. I also really like how easy it is for your to clean the pen holder, but not the device holder. I didn't appreciate their warranty policy.

"I've only had this little workhorse about a week, and it's completely met, and surpassed, my expectations--not to mention those of my geek son. While it's not perfect, it's quite incredible for its price. There will always be some tasks done more efficiently on my desktop, this gives me the ability to get much of my work done from my recliner: not a trivial matter when limited by health.<br /><br />Some things are quite noteworthy. The  keyboard is a comfortable size, and it's arranged intelligently. They keys are responsive, and the trackpad works well. I like that it's so thin, too, yet it doesn't feel flimsy. The whole, when the keyboard is folded closed, is still remarkably thin. I haven't a lot of experience with convertibles, but it separates into its components without great difficulty once you try it a couple of times--but it feels like it's built to last. It doesn't swing in a wide arc, due to it's magnetic hinge assembly, but I don't find that to be a major irritation. If that changes I'll try to edit this review. Even with the keyboard on, it's easy to use the touch functions as though it were just a tablet. The screen has good color and definitely adequate resolution. I haven't done any serious photo editing on it as that's a function that will be better performed on my desktop, but I haven't felt any lack when it comes to photo viewing on it. I like its weight, and find myself carrying the whole around most of the time.<br /><br />No, for its price it doesn't come with MS Office, but I'm generally happy with the freeware office products out there--but if you want to pay for your office software, be my guest. After coming to depend on a smaller tablet, and finding the frustrations of a tiny screen, this one is a real pleasure. It's big enough I can read the default fonts easily, and even manage to select the proper choice on drop-down menus when it's just a tablet.<br /><br />A good investment, and reasonably priced, that's been well thought out.<br /><br />Updated June 2016:<br />Okay, this tablet has some things I don't love, and I've reduced my rating to four stars.<br /><br />The physical button arrangement is less convenient than other tablets, with the volume button on the side, so to adjust volume I have to use my other hand to counter-balance the pressure on the volume. If it were on the top, with the power switch, this wouldn't be an issue, at least when it's got the keyboard attached and I'm using it laptop style.<br /><br />Perhaps it's just mine, but sometimes I have to start it twice, as it hangs up in the boot process.

Unfortunately they are too small to fit. About 15% smaller in size than what I need.<br /><br />The replacement pads seem to be of good quality - and I think they would have been a more than adequate replacement if they had fit.

"I had bought a bunch of these years ago, but you can no longer find them and I've yet to find something similar.  This actually worked quite well allowing you to specify your skin type and SPF you have on.  It then measures the UV and starts a countdown timer of how long you can be exposed before you will burn.  The problem is it's a battery powered device with an LCD display that you're supposed to leave in the sun. Unfortunately that same sun causes the device and LCD to overheat to point where it becomes damaged and fails.

"Anker comes through again. What I was looking for was a Bluetooth earphone that had a long battery life and these Anchor SoundBuds deliver. Sound wise they are sound pretty good, not as good as my Etymotic wire earphones but quiet good considering the limitations of the BlueTooth on my iPhone 7+.  They also instantly pair up with my iPhone. The battery life is impressive I have been 11 hours and they still are not signalling for a refresh. The SoundBuds are well constructed. I like the fact the charging port is located on the control module on the cross cable. The control module is larger than most and the control buttons are widely spaced making their use out of sight easy. The ear pieces fit well and for me very comfortable for extended periods of time. I have not had to screw them around to get a proper seal for the best sound. I have purchased a lot of earphones of this design these are the best.<br /><br />Update. 17 Oct 2017. Unfortunately I am returning these earbuds. I very much like them however the adhesive holding the left earpiece togather failed and it came appart.

"As a Mac user, I was really surprised by how much I liked this PC. It’s quite capable for almost every use case I threw at it, other than maybe hard-core gaming.  It had been a while since I regularly used a Windows based machine, and Windows 10 really impressed me. Integration with Office365 was flawless.<br /><br />The CPU was plenty fast, even for applications like Photoshop.  For browsing, word processing, or image editing, I had no slowdowns that made me wish I had a faster CPU.<br /><br />I was also impressed by the screen. It’s the first laptop I’ve owned with a touchscreen and the ability to essentially turn itself into a tablet.  I was impressed by how well Windows 10 handled that transition. Overall, I think it’s a really nice screen.  I haven’t used the included stylus much, but it was responsive enough when I tested it out.  I’m just not sure I’ll have much reason to use it. The touchscreen also is another novelty I'm not sure will be all that useful for me in the long run, but I could see how many people would enjoy it.<br /><br />Battery life was really good, I thought.  I think some of that has to do with how well Windows 10 manages power compared to past versions.<br /><br />And now for some negatives: it’s definitely heavier than I was expecting. It’s about what you’d expect from the weight of a laptop, but in tablet mode, it’s definitely on the heavy side.  I also would have preferred a larger hard drive, but it is a SSD, which makes it really fast.<br /><br />Overall I’d definitely recommend this laptop/tablet hybrid.<br /><br />Positives:<br />-  Windows 10 is great<br />-  CPU is plenty fast for most users<br />-  Ability to transform into a tablet is nice<br />-  Screen was very easy on the eyes<br /><br />-  Great battery life<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-  Heavy when used as a tablet<br />-  Fast hard drive, but very small, would need to really rely on cloud storage",4.0,as a mac user i was really surprised by how much i liked this pc its quite capable for almost every use case i threw at it other than maybe hardcore gaming it had been a while since i regularly used a windows based machine and windows really impressed me integration with office was flawlessbr br the cpu was plenty fast even for applications like photoshop for browsing word processing or image editing i had no slowdowns that made me wish i had a faster cpubr br i was also impressed by the screen its the first laptop ive owned with a touchscreen and the ability to essentially turn itself into a tablet i was impressed by how well windows handled that transition overall i think its a really nice screen i havent used the included stylus much but it was responsive enough when i tested it out im just not sure ill have much reason to use it the touchscreen also is another novelty im not sure will be all that useful for me in the long run but i could see how many people would enjoy itbr br battery life was really good i thought i think some of that has to do with how well windows manages power compared to past versionsbr br and now for some negatives its definitely heavier than i was expecting its about what youd expect from the weight of a laptop but in tablet mode its definitely on the heavy side i also would have preferred a larger hard drive but it is a ssd which makes it really fastbr br overall id definitely recommend this laptoptablet hybridbr br positivesbr windows is greatbr cpu is plenty fast for most usersbr ability to transform into a tablet is nicebr screen was very easy on the eyesbr br great battery lifebr br negativesbr heavy when used as a tabletbr fast hard drive but very small would need to really rely on cloud storage,1758

"[[VIDEOID:842229ac2eae9c7bf58c428f875692c4]] I have owned this TV for approximately 16 months and have deliberately waited to post a review to ensure it is accurate and not based on an initial honeymoon period after purchase.  It was also purchased within weeks of a similar LG smart TV which is used for comparison.<br /><br />I am not a tech person and I rate this as four stars based on functionality for the average user, nor am I someone who likes to game or values an intense movie experience.  The TV installed quickly and was mounted to a wall mount with no additional hardware needed.  The picture quality is excellent and we use to stream in HD on Netflix, Prime, and Disney+.  Sound is also great.  There are two parts of this TV that I like most.  First is the internet connectivity which has never disconnected.  The WiFi connection for our LG TV constantly disconnected to the point we plugged in a Fire TV stick.  The WiFi connectivity of this Toshiba is refreshingly problem free and it has never disconnected.  The second part of this TV that I like is the simplicity of the remote.  It is basically a Fire TV remote and isn't overly complex like the LG remote.  Navigation of the TV settings and controls is also easy.  Bottom line is that this Toshiba Fire TV works great to interface with Prime and other apps for those who stream their TV shows and movies.  I would purchase again and recommend this TV.",4.0,videoidaceaecbfcfc i have owned this tv for approximately months and have deliberately waited to post a review to ensure it is accurate and not based on an initial honeymoon period after purchase it was also purchased within weeks of a similar lg smart tv which is used for comparisonbr br i am not a tech person and i rate this as four stars based on functionality for the average user nor am i someone who likes to game or values an intense movie experience the tv installed quickly and was mounted to a wall mount with no additional hardware needed the picture quality is excellent and we use to stream in hd on netflix prime and disney sound is also great there are two parts of this tv that i like most first is the internet connectivity which has never disconnected the wifi connection for our lg tv constantly disconnected to the point we plugged in a fire tv stick the wifi connectivity of this toshiba is refreshingly problem free and it has never disconnected the second part of this tv that i like is the simplicity of the remote it is basically a fire tv remote and isnt overly complex like the lg remote navigation of the tv settings and controls is also easy bottom line is that this toshiba fire tv works great to interface with prime and other apps for those who stream their tv shows and movies i would purchase again and recommend this tv,1356

"The concept of building degrees of surround sound is pretty cool--nice use of bluetooth, and had the sound quality been better, it would probably be a worthwhile investment since it works with every device I have tried it with (iPhone, iPad, a few laptops). The initial setup isn't quite as straightforward as pressing a button and waiting for it to show on the other device's screen, but it's not horrible either; it just requires a little reading in the instruction book. Once paired, the devices find themselves easily and it's no longer an issue.<br />As for the sound, it's a little tinny and doesn't carry as far as other brands in my home (Pioneer and Bose), and considering this one isn't that much cheaper, it might be worthwhile paying the extra hundred or so dollars for one of the leading brands; however, the fact these can be paired with each other to create surround sound does make a compelling argument for buying them.<br />Interesting and useful product with decent but not excellent sound.",4.0,the concept of building degrees of surround sound is pretty coolnice use of bluetooth and had the sound quality been better it would probably be a worthwhile investment since it works with every device i have tried it with iphone ipad a few laptops the initial setup isnt quite as straightforward as pressing a button and waiting for it to show on the other devices screen but its not horrible either it just requires a little reading in the instruction book once paired the devices find themselves easily and its no longer an issuebr as for the sound its a little tinny and doesnt carry as far as other brands in my home pioneer and bose and considering this one isnt that much cheaper it might be worthwhile paying the extra hundred or so dollars for one of the leading brands however the fact these can be paired with each other to create surround sound does make a compelling argument for buying thembr interesting and useful product with decent but not excellent sound,973

"I used this to hook up my xDuoo TA-30 to the wall receptacle.  It delivers power and sounds good (it already sounded good using the included ~ $1 cable).  It looks sweet, especially with the steam punk look of the giant rectifier and pre amp tubes.  All in all, not bad for the price.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1) it's ridiculously impractical--the thick and stiff cable starts to pull the very hefty xDuoo TA-30, and the cable's limited flexibility limits placement.  This makes the 1M length a bit misleading, as you lose 1/3 the length to large radius turns from a table/shelf/desk to vertical and back to horizontal for the outlet.  This also means that the unit needs to be away from the edge and wall and likewise the cord sticks out far from the wall.  It's a usability nightmare.<br />2) Have you ever seen the wires that go through your walls, how they are connected to each other, and the overall power grid leading to your home?  Is the step down transformer in the neighborhood audiophile grade?  Is the copper in your walls OFC?  Probably not.<br /><br />Anyway, if it weren't so hard to place, the good looks would still suffice, but I kinda hate this due to that issue.",4.0,i used this to hook up my xduoo ta to the wall receptacle it delivers power and sounds good it already sounded good using the included cable it looks sweet especially with the steam punk look of the giant rectifier and pre amp tubes all in all not bad for the pricebr br howeverbr br its ridiculously impracticalthe thick and stiff cable starts to pull the very hefty xduoo ta and the cables limited flexibility limits placement this makes the m length a bit misleading as you lose the length to large radius turns from a tableshelfdesk to vertical and back to horizontal for the outlet this also means that the unit needs to be away from the edge and wall and likewise the cord sticks out far from the wall its a usability nightmarebr have you ever seen the wires that go through your walls how they are connected to each other and the overall power grid leading to your home is the step down transformer in the neighborhood audiophile grade is the copper in your walls ofc probably notbr br anyway if it werent so hard to place the good looks would still suffice but i kinda hate this due to that issue,1104

I decided to just do a quick test with a simple an quick installation. I put both of the fans at the top corners blowing in. I used the double stick pads that came with the set.  I started monitoring the temperatures on the AX86U. Initially the CPU was at 68C and the radios at 47C and 50C for 2.4 gig and 5 gig radios respectively.  It took about half an hour, but the temps are now stable at 47C for the CPU and 36C for both radios.<br />I am impressed. For less than 5 minutes worth of work, and around $12 I have a significant reduction in heat.<br />Now to see whether the reliability problems that have been reported strike my fans.

"-  First off, as of July 2014, you can get this sweet baby NEW on clearance for 749 at BB...hurry up and get there already! before the 10% reward points bonus is over.<br />-  I actually bought an open box demo and saved myself an extra Franklin.  I was planing to get a 42in til I saw the deal on this puppy...couldn't pass it up! I have had this a few weeks now and ready to spring a review.<br />-  I read an online review while I was scrutinizing it on the showroom floor. All the cons the author talked about like ghosting and and poor viewing angles seemed completely fabricated to me...maybe he cut and pasted from the 2008 model or something. This TV is very capable...it rocks!<br />-  Unbelievable bargain for those Few that happen to use a PS3, Xbox, Roku, etc, etc to add &#34;smartness&#34; to their TV viewing. No apps on this one...no upcharge either.  No Problem at all watching Amazon Prime thru my PSx.<br />- I actually prefer the VIVID setting (as they had it set in the store) for my viewing, even though my room is darlk...I like colors to pop! Vivid is good eXpecially for 3D content which seems to dim the picture down about 30-50%...I didn't expect that with active 3D glasses. I always heard that passive cuts the light in half, but apparently so does active 3D.<br />- I am really impressed with the ability of the panel to deliver &#34;synthetic&#34; 3D from whatever you are watching. However, after an hour I tend to get a headache, so I use it sparingly. I'll update again after I watch an actual Hobbit 3D bluray this week. I did not notice any ghosting either. I like the 3D button on the remote which skips the menus.<br />- I have to admit, the remote and the features on this TV could use some work. My Sharp Aquos has a &#34;view&#34; button that allows me to flip through a few screen fitting adjustments and I have never had a problem getting what I like out of it to easily fit on the screen. I find myself watching a lot of 720p content on this TV in a smaller boxed area, If you magnify it, then its too big to fit on the screen and you lose content. That just seems stupid to me...if Sharp can do it, why can't Samsung? I also like all the shortcut buttons on the Sharp remote, where with Samsung I feel I am spending waay too much time in the menus to get things done.<br />-  The speakers are actually impressive for 8 watts, that being said...they should have been at least 15 watts. I have it on 45 volume if the aircon is on, any louder than that, it starts to get distortion. So they definitely skimped on the speakers a bit more than they should have. This TV is my travel partner, so no surround system is going to accompany me to hotels or temporary living sites. One thing I have considered, is using the headphone jack with a set of PC speakers...if I get that setup I will update the review about how that worked out.<br />- I have not done much gaming on it yet, but so far it seems fine. I will update if I see any lag problems. I typically play mostly RPG's where that is rarely a big issue.<br />-  All-in-all I have No deal-breaking complaints about the TV so I am giving it 4 stars. Based on price it could possibly be a quarter to half a point more than that. Too bad they don't have a 1 to 10 scale on amazon. It definitely helps sooth my Sharp Aquos withdrawal pangs when I am working away from home.",4.0,first off as of july you can get this sweet baby new on clearance for at bbhurry up and get there already before the reward points bonus is overbr i actually bought an open box demo and saved myself an extra franklin i was planing to get a in til i saw the deal on this puppycouldnt pass it up i have had this a few weeks now and ready to spring a reviewbr i read an online review while i was scrutinizing it on the showroom floor all the cons the author talked about like ghosting and and poor viewing angles seemed completely fabricated to memaybe he cut and pasted from the model or something this tv is very capableit rocksbr unbelievable bargain for those few that happen to use a ps xbox roku etc etc to add smartness to their tv viewing no apps on this oneno upcharge either no problem at all watching amazon prime thru my psxbr i actually prefer the vivid setting as they had it set in the store for my viewing even though my room is darlki like colors to pop vivid is good expecially for d content which seems to dim the picture down about i didnt expect that with active d glasses i always heard that passive cuts the light in half but apparently so does active dbr i am really impressed with the ability of the panel to deliver synthetic d from whatever you are watching however after an hour i tend to get a headache so i use it sparingly ill update again after i watch an actual hobbit d bluray this week i did not notice any ghosting either i like the d button on the remote which skips the menusbr i have to admit the remote and the features on this tv could use some work my sharp aquos has a view button that allows me to flip through a few screen fitting adjustments and i have never had a problem getting what i like out of it to easily fit on the screen i find myself watching a lot of p content on this tv in a smaller boxed area if you magnify it then its too big to fit on the screen and you lose content that just seems stupid to meif sharp can do it why cant samsung i also like all the shortcut buttons on the sharp remote where with samsung i feel i am spending waay too much time in the menus to get things donebr the speakers are actually impressive for watts that being saidthey should have been at least watts i have it on volume if the aircon is on any louder than that it starts to get distortion so they definitely skimped on the speakers a bit more than they should have this tv is my travel partner so no surround system is going to accompany me to hotels or temporary living sites one thing i have considered is using the headphone jack with a set of pc speakersif i get that setup i will update the review about how that worked outbr i have not done much gaming on it yet but so far it seems fine i will update if i see any lag problems i typically play mostly rpgs where that is rarely a big issuebr allinall i have no dealbreaking complaints about the tv so i am giving it stars based on price it could possibly be a quarter to half a point more than that too bad they dont have a to scale on amazon it definitely helps sooth my sharp aquos withdrawal pangs when i am working away from home,3130

"I will say that this is the best Tile I've tested.  However, the entire Tile concept is overpriced.  It relies on Bluetooth, which works well at home, but I purposefully have left one as a test in various locations and came back a few days later having it never been in range of anyone running the app.  BUT, if I'm just getting this for around the house, you can get packs of 5 that work with a proprietary remote for like $10 (with other brands)!

"This is a pretty large device. The good news is that there’s quite a bit of room between the outlets so large plugs will fit easily.  I like that it comes in black or white. It has a nice long power cord that is convenient.  900 joules of surge protection is on the low side of surge protection but sufficient for my needs. What I dislike is quite a long list:<br />1. There is no UL listed markings on the device itself. So it’s unlikely it is UL listed. If the seller can provide the proper UL documentation I will gladly update this. The lack of markings from UL labs, means it’s likely we have been lied to. Doesn’t inspire confidence in an electrical device. Is it really a surge protector or just a power strip?<br />2. There is no manufacturer address, toll free number or company email address. It has an email address at outlook.com. Not valas.com or some parent company.<br />3. Strange looking warranty - see photo<br />4. Inattention to detail in the manual. There’s a typo on the manual (the piece of paper included in the box) that states it’s 300,000watts. - see photo.<br />5. Amazon listing has inconsistencies. For example, they state it has a flat plug at one point, yet show a normal plug on all the pictures. It does have a normal plug. They state it has a two year warranty on the Amazon listing, but the piece of paper in the box states one year.<br />6. I am not noticing the childproof covers they mention?<br />7. The 3rd (out of 7 photos you can scroll through at the top of the Amazon listing) shows 1300J joules of surge protection. The rest of the listing says 900 joules. Strange inaccuracies. Maybe they make a different surge protector that looks similar and used the wrong photo? Either that, or someone accidentally typed 1300 instead of 900?<br /><br />I don’t have a lot of confidence in this. I am using it, but will try to remember to unplug it before leaving the house.

"UPDATE: After using this thing for a year I am lowering my review from 5 stars to 3.<br />Although all the things I said in my initial review are still true. I realized that this laptop always defaults to the onboard graphics card that has lower specs than the dedicated. It has a GTX 960M, which is listed on the nvidia website as 4k capable. I tried to force it into 4k mode for a drawing tablet on photoshop, with a tablet monitor capable of 4k and it wouldn't do it. And because this is a mobile GPU card, there was no option to plug directly to the dedicated card to bypass the onboard card. Tried it with other things like games, and could not force it into 4k even when using nvidia control panel to specify which card you want a program to use.<br /><br />That was very disappointing as part of the appeal of buying this is the relatively powerful mobile graphics card. Not being able to use it fully due to the setup is lowering the value of this laptop.<br />__________________________________________________________________________________<br />This laptop is pretty beast. I had a ROG g75vw and while it was fine, it was much heavier than this laptop at about 9-10lbs. The old laptop also didn't fit in my backpack without a lot of cramming. This one is more powerful, and more compact, but beware, the battery life sucks if you're trying to use it for gaming. For regular internet surfing without a lot of background applications running, you can reasonably expect the battery to last 1-3 hours on a medium brightness setting. I use it as a desktop replacement, so it never becomes an issue for me.<br /><br />The other thing to note, the battery on this laptop is on the inside. It seems like with every new line Asus makes, they try more and more to replicate Macbooks with their sleek lines, gestures and tamper-proof components. I initially liked Asus because even in the laptops they would make the components accessible, easy to clean and easy to modify. Now even the battery can't be accessed without a screwdriver...<br />There's only 4 USB A ports on this laptop. There's space for one more, but the last USB port is a USB C port, which sort of a waste of a port for now, but will come in handy in the future when everyone converts to it.<br /><br />Besides that, the actual performance of the machine is great. If you get rid of all the bloatware, it is blazing fast and boots in only a few second if you have quick boot enabled in BIOS. I didn't like the windows 10 scheme, so I used start10 to fix the interface. After that it was perfect!<br /><br />tl;dr some flaws, but overall great for normal use, gaming and graphic design that needs heavy processing power (digital painting).",3.0,update after using this thing for a year i am lowering my review from stars to br although all the things i said in my initial review are still true i realized that this laptop always defaults to the onboard graphics card that has lower specs than the dedicated it has a gtx m which is listed on the nvidia website as k capable i tried to force it into k mode for a drawing tablet on photoshop with a tablet monitor capable of k and it wouldnt do it and because this is a mobile gpu card there was no option to plug directly to the dedicated card to bypass the onboard card tried it with other things like games and could not force it into k even when using nvidia control panel to specify which card you want a program to usebr br that was very disappointing as part of the appeal of buying this is the relatively powerful mobile graphics card not being able to use it fully due to the setup is lowering the value of this laptopbr __________________________________________________________________________________br this laptop is pretty beast i had a rog gvw and while it was fine it was much heavier than this laptop at about lbs the old laptop also didnt fit in my backpack without a lot of cramming this one is more powerful and more compact but beware the battery life sucks if youre trying to use it for gaming for regular internet surfing without a lot of background applications running you can reasonably expect the battery to last hours on a medium brightness setting i use it as a desktop replacement so it never becomes an issue for mebr br the other thing to note the battery on this laptop is on the inside it seems like with every new line asus makes they try more and more to replicate macbooks with their sleek lines gestures and tamperproof components i initially liked asus because even in the laptops they would make the components accessible easy to clean and easy to modify now even the battery cant be accessed without a screwdriverbr theres only usb a ports on this laptop theres space for one more but the last usb port is a usb c port which sort of a waste of a port for now but will come in handy in the future when everyone converts to itbr br besides that the actual performance of the machine is great if you get rid of all the bloatware it is blazing fast and boots in only a few second if you have quick boot enabled in bios i didnt like the windows scheme so i used start to fix the interface after that it was perfectbr br tldr some flaws but overall great for normal use gaming and graphic design that needs heavy processing power digital painting,2583

"This is the worst Harmony I've ever used.  It's an ergonomic disaster with little that is done right.  It is however still a Harmony, so it somehow salvages 3 stars for what they all do right.<br /><br />It seemed nice in the box, and it was a breeze transferring everything from my Harmony 700 to this via the My Harmony program.  The weight and balance are good and the charging cradle works well.  Everything else ranges from bad to worse.<br /><br />Maybe one day the screen/pad will do what I need it to do, but for now it's rubbish and it's in the location where the most used buttons should be.  As a result those buttons are below (4 way controller, volume, channel, etc... or above (play, pause, etc...).  Ugh!  Worse yet the screen/pad isn't just dead space (honestly it would be better if it were), rather it's live.  That can be ok when it's acting like a touch pad with various taps and swipes to do things (it never works that well, but I see what they're trying to do), but it's a disaster when it's live with functions that are so seldom used there's no dedicated button.  So channel favorites, random superfluous functions, etc get accidentally pressed.  Even then they hardly work in the case of the favorites with my Motorola cable box running Uverse (95% of the time 2 or 3 of the 4 digits are recognized).  When you avoid that pad the other buttons are cramped and arranged poorly even within their poor locations.  The 4 way pad is small, as are the play and pause buttons and the skip and fast forward buttons are shared.  Of all the sacrifices made for the screen/pad, those red, green, yellow, and blue buttons you never use are still there--UGH!!!!!<br /><br />Move the screen up, move the key buttons where the fingers land, kill the color keyed buttons that don't ever do s***, and try again.  Oh and the battery life sucks too.  Please make a new flagship controller ala the Harmony One (original) 880, etc...

"I got this new FireStick because my old fire stick was several years old and friends said I should get a new one which would be much faster, downloading etc.  Well, I don't know if it's faster --- probably, I'm usually in no hurry. I have Alexa on my new cell phone and now on my new Firestick. Neither one seems to understand me.  I ordinary am a fast talker and even took special 'diction' classes (in the drama department) in college - several decades ago. Still, the few times I have attempted to slow down and actually use Alexa - it comes up with something totally alien to what I had said --- so, I  have decided to not try to use it anymore.

"My SE115 sure headphones were purchased after a recommendation from a friend.  They worked great for one year.  The headphones cut out noise from outside, and introduced nice quality sound from my MP3 player.  And, I used these headphones everyday for the last year.  Wow, the difference was excellent.  It took only a few days to get used to it.  And, I took very good care of them.  Kept them in the bag, which was supplied. OK.  These headphones have outlasted all my other headphones. I used to have the SONY noise cancelling headphones, and some other earbud phones.  SE115 was much better. But now, I need to replace them.  After 1 year of heavy use,  I hope the SHURE company will honor some replacement.  Ok, I did a lot of sweating and moving ... with these phones plugged into my ears.  But ...

"Let's start with the good:<br /><br />The design is great. Very minimal bezels, mostly metal body, and good looking (and sturdy) legs. The top 2/3 of the screen is very thin. Bottom 1/3 is thicker, but houses all the internals.<br /><br />The panel is great for a TV of this price. Not the brightest, but will do for most environments. Displays a wide color gamut and has low input lag in game mode<br /><br />The UI is good, not great. Android TV feels familiar if you use an Android phone and actually allows the TV to be setup using an Android device. Still some bugs with certain apps force closing.<br /><br />The sound is about as good as you can get in a TV. Due to the form factor you're obviously not going to be getting deep bass. Rather shallow sound. But that's TV speakers for you.<br /><br />Now the not so good:<br /><br />Frame bent: This isn't necessarily LeEco's fault, but about halfway across the top the frame was bent. Imagine the iphone bend problem...it looked like that. Luckily, it didn't seem to affect the panel itself. It was there from box opening. I 2 person lifted the TV properly, so it wasn't my handling that caused the damage.<br /><br />Light bleed: For some reason LeEco decided to light the entire screen from the bottom. On dark content you can definitely see a small strip of light bleed on the bottom edge.<br /><br />Clouding: Again, on dark scenes you can see some clouding of the blacks. It's hard not to notice once you spot it. Bright and/or colorful scenes don't suffer.<br /><br />So in summary, this TV is good, but not without flaws. I got it for under $700, which is a good price for what you're getting here. Panel differences could eliminate the clouding or light bleed issue, along with the bent frame. I definitely wanted to like this TV, it looks excellent in my living room. Right now, I've purchased a refurb Samsung KS8000 to test this one against.

"It's near impossible to tell if there's anything behind my jeep. I wanted to be able to see behind me and I also wanted a forward camera to be able to record trail rides. I went with this mirror dash cam. I didn't even know these things existed until recently.<br /><br />For recording, I'm using a samsung high endurance 64GB SD card. The  built in formatting function is simple and quick. The video feeds for front and rear cameras are pretty clear. Going from one view to the other or both takes a a swipe.<br /><br />I removed the OEM mirror and installed this as a full replacement. One thing about this mount vs the OEM, is that this one vibrates badly. Also, there's only one part that rotates behind the mirror. Whereas the OEM mirror rotates at the base and the mirror.<br /><br />I stuck the reverse camera in the middle of spare tire mount. There was more than enough enough wire to run along the cage length of my jeep wrangler unlimited. I did not hook up the wire for the reverse lines, but the camera is live without it. It connects through a slim single plug from rear camera to mirror.<br /><br />As for trying to use the rear camera full time instead of the mirror surface, there's still quite a bit of reflection. Even at full brightness. To cut down on the amount of reflection, you need to point the mirror at yourself instead of the towards the rear of the vehicle as you would do with a regular mirror. Which can be difficult since there's only that one pivot on this mirror.<br /><br />One thing that was necessary for me, was to get the latest firmware. Out of the box, there's no way to turn off the loud music that plays when the mirror powers on and off. It'd be nice to have actual volume control even with the firmware, there's only on and off. There's no way I could have kept this mirror without being able to turn that sound off.<br /><br />One other thing I'd like is a GPS module so I could overlay speed and even record trails overlays for off roading.

"OK. I know this i a $15 item and therefore, I shouldn't expect too much. The unit I received was defaulted to Chinese, with printed instructions in both  Chinese and English. It was a bit difficult for me to figure out how to change to English. That being said, The suction cup mount works very well, holding it in position well. Even though the directions mentioned turning the IR (night vision) OFF/ON, I couldn't find anything in the menus to do that.  The big letdown was that the LCD screen randomly displaying lines, then whiting out the screen entirely, even sitting on a table, so I don't think motion was a problem.

"This case comprises two shallow, hard plastic &#34;shells&#34; that snap very tightly onto the top and bottom of the Yoga 2 Pro. The fit is so tight that at first I was concerned the covers might be a bit too small, but it turned out they were exactly right. You have to be careful to apply pressure where the little retaining nubs are located -- squeezing the covers in between nubs won't afford enough pressure where it's needed and the plastic will just bend. There could also be some risk of applying too much force to the super-thin screen portion of the Yoga 2 Pro, so be careful. The injection-molded shells, however, proved to be very precisely made, and once snapped in place they fit perfectly.<br /><br />That said, I was disappointed to find that the covers are just a little too thick to permit the Yoga 2 Pro to fold all the way back into &#34;tablet&#34; mode. The thickness of two additional layers of plastic was just enough so that I imagine you could damage the hinges if you were to force the screen flat back against the bottom part of the laptop. This isn't a deal breaker, but it does rule out one of the appealing &#34;asana positions&#34; of the Yoga 2 Pro.<br /><br />This kind of case isn't intended to cover the entire computer, so don't be surprised that the vents and edges of the Yoga 2 Pro are still exposed to the world. If you're using the computer mainly as a laptop, or in the other &#34;positions&#34; (lying flat open, or in tent or backwards position), the shell case doesn't interfere at all -- only the fully folded-back tablet position is disallowed.<br /><br />I will probably use this case now and then, after I've had more time to determine how important tablet position really is. The case is a good way to protect the outer surfaces of the computer, but obviously if you need protection from rain and dust and more rough treatment, a more conventional full-coverage case would be required.",3.0,this case comprises two shallow hard plastic shells that snap very tightly onto the top and bottom of the yoga pro the fit is so tight that at first i was concerned the covers might be a bit too small but it turned out they were exactly right you have to be careful to apply pressure where the little retaining nubs are located squeezing the covers in between nubs wont afford enough pressure where its needed and the plastic will just bend there could also be some risk of applying too much force to the superthin screen portion of the yoga pro so be careful the injectionmolded shells however proved to be very precisely made and once snapped in place they fit perfectlybr br that said i was disappointed to find that the covers are just a little too thick to permit the yoga pro to fold all the way back into tablet mode the thickness of two additional layers of plastic was just enough so that i imagine you could damage the hinges if you were to force the screen flat back against the bottom part of the laptop this isnt a deal breaker but it does rule out one of the appealing asana positions of the yoga probr br this kind of case isnt intended to cover the entire computer so dont be surprised that the vents and edges of the yoga pro are still exposed to the world if youre using the computer mainly as a laptop or in the other positions lying flat open or in tent or backwards position the shell case doesnt interfere at all only the fully foldedback tablet position is disallowedbr br i will probably use this case now and then after ive had more time to determine how important tablet position really is the case is a good way to protect the outer surfaces of the computer but obviously if you need protection from rain and dust and more rough treatment a more conventional fullcoverage case would be required,1821
"I mainly ordered this product so I can have some contrast in colors with the pen.  When placing the pen on top of, let's say, white blankets or bed sheets, it's actually difficult to find.  This product took care of that issue.  The cons: the Apple Pencil is designed to stick on and charge through the side of the iPad.  This product, although you can get it to stick and charge on the iPad, the product somehow weakens the magnetic connection by putting a little more depth and no direct contact between the pen and the iPad which causes the pen to fall off the iPad a lot easier.  Now, I do not recommend anyone to travel and transport the pen on the side of the iPad, this product does make it a whole lot more unsafe to do so (greater risk of losing your pen).  As far as the grip of the pen, I guess it's a little better, but for that feature, it is definitely not a ""night and day"" difference.  My feelings on this product is neutral.  If you're looking for contrast against white objects, this product is great, but if your sole purpose is anything else, I do not recommend this product.",3.0,i mainly ordered this product so i can have some contrast in colors with the pen when placing the pen on top of lets say white blankets or bed sheets its actually difficult to find this product took care of that issue the cons the apple pencil is designed to stick on and charge through the side of the ipad this product although you can get it to stick and charge on the ipad the product somehow weakens the magnetic connection by putting a little more depth and no direct contact between the pen and the ipad which causes the pen to fall off the ipad a lot easier now i do not recommend anyone to travel and transport the pen on the side of the ipad this product does make it a whole lot more unsafe to do so greater risk of losing your pen as far as the grip of the pen i guess its a little better but for that feature it is definitely not a night and day difference my feelings on this product is neutral if youre looking for contrast against white objects this product is great but if your sole purpose is anything else i do not recommend this product,1056

"My wife bought me a Squeezebox for Xmas 2011. It was the only item on my list because, what can you actually get for the guy who has everything?  This is a sleek design and it has a very nice look on any shelf. The sound quality is excellent given the size and you can even crank up the volume if you like. It has 6 stations you can preset so that you don't have to keep searching for the stations you like.<br /><br />My two daughters speak fluent french because of an early education French immersion program, so I thought it would be fun to listen to the Paris, France' version of National Public Radio. No problem tuning it in although it does seem to take a few more steps than necessary.  Logitech could do a little more work on their user interface to make it a tad more user friendly.<br /><br />A nice feature is that you don't have to turn on the power button to get a preset station as it is programmed to just come on when you press your preset. A small thing but with all the buttons we need to press these days I like the fact that they designed this one less button to push feature.<br /><br />When first set up on my wireless network it found it straight away. Input my password, and I set up on the wireless and away you go.....for the first time that is! Logitech did not design the radio with a two way wireless receiver, which means it will find a port on your router to start, but if your network goes down and ask the Squeezebox to establish a new IP address, NO LOVE!<br /><br />At first I thought I had a defective unit, not really knowing what they designed into the circuitry. I have worked in the high tech industry for years and have a cursory knowledged of how an IP enabled device would get its' connection.  I called tech support at Logitech.  BE PREPARED to wait for a long time to get someone on the line.<br /><br />Below is the instructions I received via email from Logitech:<br /><br />To allow the squeezebox proper access to your home network please open the following ports.<br /><br />Port number: 3483 (TCP) - Name: Server Control<br /><br />Port number: 3483 (UDP) - Name: ServerDiscovery<br /><br />Port number: 9000 (TCP) - Name: Server Web<br /><br />Port number: 9090 (TCP) - Name: Server MySQL<br /><br />Port Number: 9092 (TCP) - Name: Server MySQL<br /><br />Basically I have to figure out how to block these ports so that only the Squeezebox gets access to them.

It is slow and has a modest zoom range. Color is slightly dull. However it does look sharp enough at f/8 and captures plenty of color to make a workable file. For the same price you can get the 50mm f/1.8 which is head and shoulders better than this lens by every single criterion.

"I haven't had this device for long, but so far I think I agree with most of the positive reviews here. One thing I have not seen mentioned, however, is that there seems to be no way to have the player adjust the image of anamorphic DVD sources such that the picture fills the screen as much as possible.<br /><br />If you've got a 16:9 TV, then you're familiar with the various ""stretch"" viewing modes, and how with many sources the image must be ""stretched"" in the vertical direction in order for it to fill the screen and (more importantly) for the image to be rendered at the right aspect ratio. In other words, if the movie has a shot of a basketball, the basketball should look like a basketball, not a blunt football.<br /><br />With this player, the only means I've found to get the aspect ratio right for anamorphic disks is to tell it to use the 4:3 TV setting. That corrects the aspect ratio problem, but it leaves about half the screen unused - that half-screen is more-or-less what I wanted when I paid extra for this thing!<br /><br />Anamorphic DVDs are not rare, by any means! As I was picking DVDs from my shelf to test the player, I found that the first 5 I picked were anamorphic. It's something I generally don't think about at all, because all my other playback mechanisms are capable of dealing with that format. Apparently, the Philips people decided it wasn't really important for this device.

I have an older model where the power button is on the front and there's a hold slide switch on the side of the player.

"In May of 2011, my husband and I had sold our house preparing to move into a sweet condo in the city.  We'd made a decent profit off the sale, which we were reinvesting into top-of-the-line furniture, kitchen equipment, etc.  I don't remember how we made it into Best Buy, but we did.  He was wandering around while I was browsing myself.  I found myself hovering over the Beats by Dr. Dre display, more out of curiosity than anything else, when the husband appeared beside me.<br /><br />""Do you like those headphones?""<br /><br />""Huh?""<br /><br />""I know that you like to listen to your music on your laptop.  Do you want a pair of these?""<br /><br />""Honey, these are freaking THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS.""<br /><br />""We've got the money.  Do you want them?""<br /><br />I looked at myself with the headphones on.  Black and sleek with red accents; I looked vaguely cool.  And I said ""sure, why not?""<br /><br />And so a pair of Beats Studio came home with me.<br /><br />Flash forward to almost two years later.  I have the Beats on my head as I type.  They're comfortable.  I'm a child of the seventies and remember the ""cans"" that were headphones then and these feel very familiar.  They pick up nice licks and beats and overall I enjoy them.  But ...<br /><br />Yeah, there's ""buts"".<br /><br />First, these don't work without batteries.<br /><br />First (A), these things eat batteries like crazy.  Get rechargeable AAAs or prepare to keep Duracell or Energizer in business.  I generally have to replace batteries about once every couple of weeks and I only have them on a couple of hours a day.<br /><br />Second, these are HARD on their wires.  When you buy there will be two cords, one regular and one with a microphone so you can use them to talk on your cell phone (which is meh at best).  For some reason the wire bends at the connection to the phones and completely shreds it.  And I'm careful too.  Fortunately cheap replacement cords can be found on eBay, but still.<br /><br />Third--these are bulky with their case and if, like me, you're a light traveler they're a pain to bring along.  The noise-cancelling thing is another meh.  I had a pair of Sennheisers that were somewhat unwieldy as well but did way better in cancelling noise than these.<br /><br />For what I use them for--listening to stuff on my laptop at home--Studio Beats do the job.  Had we not been flush with cash at the time I probably would have passed on these.  If you want to look cool and aren't a major audiophile and have the cash, go for it.

"I ended up replacing this keyboard because it got so frustrating waiting for it to communicate properly with my PC. It would start to double keystrokes and miss keystrokes at the same time, and then it would just freeze and do nothing for 2, minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, even an hour or more. Restarting seemed to do nothing. Eventually it would start to work again, but then after a while it would start doing the same thing, missing keystrokes, doubling them up, and then, sure enough, it would freeze up again. This had nothing to do with how much charge the battery had. It seemed to be a malfunction in how it communicated with my PC. Placing the keyboard directly next to my PC so that it was mere inches away from the dongle seemed to help prevent it from doing this as much, but this completely defeats the point of having a wireless keyboard.

"First off, I would like to state clearly that I did return these items. Even so, there are likely people who would be okay with these headphones, so here's my take so you know what to expect.<br /><br />I've used 3 different sets of bone-conduction/induction headphones so far. Since I had such a great experience with my first pair (which were relatively cheap) I decided I was more than happy to drop more money on the next step up, which was these guys.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, they sounded exactly like the cheaper pair (which was a bit of a disappointment). So if you're deeply concerned about the sound quality, I would recommend trying out the cheaper ones first.<br /><br />Even with the quality being as it was, that was not my reason for returning them. Instead, you'll notice the large control/battery compartment behind the right ear.

I haven't purchased this camera yet but thought I'd add what I learned from a pretty knowledgeable salesman at Best Buy concerning the lens problem. Apparent some of the internal baffling in the lens was glued in place with sub par adhesive and when the baffling gets loose it jams the lens. Thus Canon can isolate the serial numbers manufactured before the problem was discovered.,3.0,i havent purchased this camera yet but thought id add what i learned from a pretty knowledgeable salesman at best buy concerning the lens problem apparent some of the internal baffling in the lens was glued in place with sub par adhesive and when the baffling gets loose it jams the lens thus canon can isolate the serial numbers manufactured before the problem was discovered,376

There are a lot of features to like about it. The material is excellent. The handle is very comfortable. It doesn't sag. Tons of space. Very secure placement of your laptop in the center of the bag. Very useful outside pockets and a great three-part zippered compartment. Somehow it feels much lighter and smaller than it is.<br /><br />On the other hand, the need to open and close buckles everytime you want to access your laptop is maddening. Yes, there are oodles of pockets, but many of them are ""ribbon""-style (open at top and bottom), which makes them only useful for large items. What really ticks me off is that there is no easily accessible place for pens. The loop on the back to put the bag on top of a roll-on bag is so flimsy my bag has slipped off a few times.<br /><br />So while there's a lot of things I really like about this bag, I am not sure I can wholeheartedly recommend it.

"This camera backpack has nice appearance but is a little hard to use because of the flaps and arrangement of pockets.  Not sure where they get the anti-theft claims, if you want anti-theft you go to PacSafe and get a bag that can't be cut.

"I have several Vizio items in my home, so I thought to give this a try when I wanted to upgrade to 802.11N. I find it very easy to set up with the basics, but not intuitive with regard to the more advanced features. Nonetheless, we had it set up and running in short order. The problem that plagued us was that we could not keep a connection. We tried many creative approaches to the problem. My earlier Motorola worked fine for several years, and was easy to set up. I gave serious thought to buying a different brand; I declined to send it back because of other reports of poor support. But reviews of different brands of routers in this class were all lacklustre. Many, it seems, are having the same problem that we were. Erratic behavior and constant dropping of signals, with no outwardly visible reason.<br /><br />We hit at last on having a small (3"" | 8cm) fan blowing on the router, even though it didn't seem very warm, much less hot. That seems to have done the trick. We have run in our ""standard"" arrangement for several weeks with no drops and plenty of bandwidth to each device. We have Ooma and a laptop plugged in (Cat 5), 3 laptops running wireless N cards, and 2 iTouches. The iTouches connect @ 2.4 GHz, the rest @ 5 GHz.<br /><br />I'll contact Vizio with my observations and see what happens, but for now we seem to be running just fine. I gave it 3 stars because a) advanced features are not easy to find (and I use them) and b) the fan, of course.<br /><br />~R~",3.0,i have several vizio items in my home so i thought to give this a try when i wanted to upgrade to n i find it very easy to set up with the basics but not intuitive with regard to the more advanced features nonetheless we had it set up and running in short order the problem that plagued us was that we could not keep a connection we tried many creative approaches to the problem my earlier motorola worked fine for several years and was easy to set up i gave serious thought to buying a different brand i declined to send it back because of other reports of poor support but reviews of different brands of routers in this class were all lacklustre many it seems are having the same problem that we were erratic behavior and constant dropping of signals with no outwardly visible reasonbr br we hit at last on having a small cm fan blowing on the router even though it didnt seem very warm much less hot that seems to have done the trick we have run in our standard arrangement for several weeks with no drops and plenty of bandwidth to each device we have ooma and a laptop plugged in cat laptops running wireless n cards and itouches the itouches connect ghz the rest ghzbr br ill contact vizio with my observations and see what happens but for now we seem to be running just fine i gave it stars because a advanced features are not easy to find and i use them and b the fan of coursebr br r,1392

"I really love the convenience of this table, but I’ve had some issues crop up since I purchased it. The main issue is that the small side tray started to lose its ability to stay at the position where I originally adjusted it. So now, rather than being a flat side table that can be used, it tilts to the back, which is frustrating. I have to put a heavier item on the front side in order for it to sit flat, and if it gets bumped, or when I roll it, things tend fall off again as it reverts to the tilted position.

"This is not a bad product, but in this particular case I just cannot get past the price.  For 1/4 the price, you could have a standard commercial style rack mount 24 port patch panel, and get mounting brackets for another $10.  For the price of this and the recommended enclosure, you could have the above noted commercial style panel with a small cabinet.<br /><br />I thought that perhaps this came with 24 individual ports that lock into place, which would be easier to wire and explain the extra cost, but it is just your standard 110 punch down on the back.  And it comes with a plastic punch down tool:  might as well just use a screwdriver.  If you're spending $200 for a patch panel, the least you can do is spend another $10 on a cheap punch down tool.<br /><br />The nice thing is this can be mounted on plywood if you don't have the home enclosure system.  It comes with 6 colors of labels and one set of plstic covers for those labels.  It has labels for 568A that can be turned over to display 568B; that is pretty cool, as it keeps you from accidentally looking at the wrong color code.<br /><br />I think the Leviton home telecomm system is pretty neat, but I'd rather go commercial style any day.

"This is my first exposure to Panasonic Active Noise Canceling (ANC) headphones. This particular model is very inexpensive relative to most ANC phones on the market, and unfortunately the low price is justified. These phones fall short in a couple of important areas.<br /><br />First and foremost, these are ANC phones and the ANC function does indeed work. That said, the degree to which it works is in line with the pricing. I have a very specific fan in the house that I use as a benchmark, as most ANC phones are able to nearly completely wipe out the white noise that this fan generates when on the lowest speed setting. The Panasonic phones kill a good bit of the fan noise but allow more noise than almost every other ANC set I have tried. In the office I tried these phones in an area serviced by two large air handlers that generate a lot of noise and these headphones did remarkably well though still not as well as most other phones I have tried in the same environment. Now, when compared to the likes of Bose, Panasonic does a very poor job but then again they cost maybe 15% of what Bose costs. When considering this price differential the Panasonic phones do a decent job with their ANC which should be acceptable by most for traveling.<br /><br />One area where these phones fail, though, is in build quality. These headphones are extremely lightweight and they feel very flimsy and fragile. These are not the headphones to take when traveling frequently. To add insult to injury, they come with a cloth carry bag which offers absolutely no protection at all beyond serving as a dust cover.<br /><br />Worse, though, is the miserable sound quality. I don't know if my specific headset is the problem but while I have a decent full range of sound, everything across the spectrum sounds slightly tinny and hollow. I was encouraged that Panasonic does not overdrive the bass as many manufacturers tend to do and instead delivers a fairly balanced spectrum, but this does not make up for the poor quality of sound. As these are inexpensive headphones I would never expect them to be audiophile quality, but the sound should absolutely be much better than it is.<br /><br />I was encouraged to see that Panasonic includes a 2-prong adapter in the package, but then they omit the 1/4&#34; adapter which is something I actually use.<br /><br />Panasonic has made a very inexpensive ANC headphone and unfortunately the low cost is justified. While the ANC capabilities are within reason for the price range, the sound quality and build quality are severely lacking. If looking for ANC phones for the purpose of using the ANC function, and keeping costs low is important, then these phones may fill that need acceptably. However, if sound quality is in any way important, these are the wrong phones and will sorely disappoint.",3.0,this is my first exposure to panasonic active noise canceling anc headphones this particular model is very inexpensive relative to most anc phones on the market and unfortunately the low price is justified these phones fall short in a couple of important areasbr br first and foremost these are anc phones and the anc function does indeed work that said the degree to which it works is in line with the pricing i have a very specific fan in the house that i use as a benchmark as most anc phones are able to nearly completely wipe out the white noise that this fan generates when on the lowest speed setting the panasonic phones kill a good bit of the fan noise but allow more noise than almost every other anc set i have tried in the office i tried these phones in an area serviced by two large air handlers that generate a lot of noise and these headphones did remarkably well though still not as well as most other phones i have tried in the same environment now when compared to the likes of bose panasonic does a very poor job but then again they cost maybe of what bose costs when considering this price differential the panasonic phones do a decent job with their anc which should be acceptable by most for travelingbr br one area where these phones fail though is in build quality these headphones are extremely lightweight and they feel very flimsy and fragile these are not the headphones to take when traveling frequently to add insult to injury they come with a cloth carry bag which offers absolutely no protection at all beyond serving as a dust coverbr br worse though is the miserable sound quality i dont know if my specific headset is the problem but while i have a decent full range of sound everything across the spectrum sounds slightly tinny and hollow i was encouraged that panasonic does not overdrive the bass as many manufacturers tend to do and instead delivers a fairly balanced spectrum but this does not make up for the poor quality of sound as these are inexpensive headphones i would never expect them to be audiophile quality but the sound should absolutely be much better than it isbr br i was encouraged to see that panasonic includes a prong adapter in the package but then they omit the adapter which is something i actually usebr br panasonic has made a very inexpensive anc headphone and unfortunately the low cost is justified while the anc capabilities are within reason for the price range the sound quality and build quality are severely lacking if looking for anc phones for the purpose of using the anc function and keeping costs low is important then these phones may fill that need acceptably however if sound quality is in any way important these are the wrong phones and will sorely disappoint,2742

"I also own and enjoy LG Tone and Motorola Buds necklace-style bluetooth earbuds. These iHome earbuds are cheaper than LG and Motorola, but you get what you pay for. Battery life on the iHome product is much worse than LG or Motorola (6-7 hours vs 10-12 hours) and long battery life is one of the main reasons I prefer the necklace-style earbuds vs the simpler styles.

"I have a [[ASIN:B00SMBG8QY VIZIO SB3821-C6 38-Inch 2.1 Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer]] but wanted to add rear speakers and a better display.  The Vizio just uses white dots in a single column for everything, not very intuitive.  So I compared this to the [[ASIN:B00SMBGP76 VIZIO SB4051-C0 40-Inch 5.1 Channel Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer and Satellite Speakers]], those being the only soundbars I could find with rear speakers.  And they're about the same price.  Unfortunately, they're not very close.<br /><br />The Samsung looks nicer, it's a lot smaller (so it won't block as much of a TV) and it has a nice alpha-numeric panel in the middle telling you what it's doing.  Much more usable.  But it's also got sound matching the smaller size - it's comparatively tinny sounding and less full.  Those are two different things.  Tinny perhaps because it's so much smaller.  But it also doesn't fill the space as well, perhaps because there are so many fewer drivers.  The Vizio has three driver-sets in the sound-bar, including for the center.  The Samsung only has left and right in it, no center.

"I thought I'd lost the charger that came with my FitBit and I can always use another wrist band so this seemed like a good deal. No where did it say that these were not Original FitBit parts but because of the price I assumed that they were NOT.  Both pieces arrived quickly and looked just like the original FitBit parts that I had. However it quickly became apparent that the charger was not an original.  My FitBit fits in the charger just fine but it does not hold in the correct position, so it does not charge.  I can't complain too much as the price was less than half of what I would have paid had I bought a replacement directly from FitBit (plus I got the  wristband too) and once I figured out the problem and came up with an easy solution it hasn't been a problem. It took me a while to figure out the problem because when I first put the fitbit into the charger it lights up but  but then it slowly pulls away from the connector pins inside the charger and then the lights go out. If you aren't watching for it you won't notice till hours later when you think it is fully charged and it isn't.  Now I just use a bit of scotch tape to hold the fitbit in the charger so that the connectors pins all stay in contact and problem is solved.

"As the bow was drawn against the strings of the Cello, by Yo-Yo Ma, the magnificently gorgeous sounding notes were released and lifted into the air.  The tone, so pure, so correct, almost made me cry.  It was as if I could hear the sound created by each individual hair of the bow.<br /><br />The sound of Chris Botti's Trumpet,  each inflection and nuance of breath, created a drama and a stirring of emotion.  I could hear for the very first time not only the sound of each note, but also how the note was created.  As the finger valves danced up and down it was as if they were in slow motion, I could hear all of the elements that make up a note, a tone, so perfect.<br /><br />Every singers voice was now real.  I now know what their true voices sound like, no coloration, nothing over-emphasized, only a perfect presentation of their tone.  These speakers in my environment do not add any excessive warmth to sound.  And they do not add an excessive brightness to the sound.  Vocal tonal character is nothing but pure joy.<br /><br />The sound can be Big, Very Big.  All you have to do is turn them up.  If you have a room that's 12 x 24 with 9' foot ceilings, these things will fill the room easily.<br /><br />Based on the above, these speakers, the Elac Uni-fi 2.0, are worth every penny of their full retail price, $600.<br /><br />Unfortunately though I sent them back, for two reasons. 1.) It was difficult to hear the snare drum or the sound of the cymbals, or the shish-shish of the high hat.  I couldn't quite make out the xylophone, or the tympany.  2.)  For me, I just wasn't getting the dynamics I wanted.  Imagine if you have two 15"" speakers and two Public Address Bull Horns surrounding you.  When the symphony plays, you feel it!  You feel it in your heart and soul.  The Uni-fi 2.0 didn't do that for me.  But to be fair nothing with a 5.25 speaker has done it for me either.<br /><br />I'm conflicted, I love the sound of the Elac Unifi 2.0 so much, I really want it to work for me.  I'm considering buying the towers at twice the cost, and a new/used amp with 200 - 300 watts per channel.  I don't know if the extra watts, and extra woofers will create the dynamics, or if I'll be able to boost the treble enough to make these my forever speakers.<br /><br />My system: Two subwoofers, 12 cf enclosures, loaded with dual 12 inch woofers.  The subs are powered by a Behringer iNuke 3000, 440 watts per sub.  My speakers are powered by a Denon 1911 avr, 90 watts/ch@8ohms.  My speakers are L/C/R, Monoprice 15"" Passive PA speakers with 1.75 compression horns, 8 ohm, 96db efficient.  The monoprice speakers do not have the tonal character of the Elac 2.0, but boy oh boy, do they have dynamics!",3.0,as the bow was drawn against the strings of the cello by yoyo ma the magnificently gorgeous sounding notes were released and lifted into the air the tone so pure so correct almost made me cry it was as if i could hear the sound created by each individual hair of the bowbr br the sound of chris bottis trumpet each inflection and nuance of breath created a drama and a stirring of emotion i could hear for the very first time not only the sound of each note but also how the note was created as the finger valves danced up and down it was as if they were in slow motion i could hear all of the elements that make up a note a tone so perfectbr br every singers voice was now real i now know what their true voices sound like no coloration nothing overemphasized only a perfect presentation of their tone these speakers in my environment do not add any excessive warmth to sound and they do not add an excessive brightness to the sound vocal tonal character is nothing but pure joybr br the sound can be big very big all you have to do is turn them up if you have a room thats x with foot ceilings these things will fill the room easilybr br based on the above these speakers the elac unifi are worth every penny of their full retail price br br unfortunately though i sent them back for two reasons it was difficult to hear the snare drum or the sound of the cymbals or the shishshish of the high hat i couldnt quite make out the xylophone or the tympany for me i just wasnt getting the dynamics i wanted imagine if you have two speakers and two public address bull horns surrounding you when the symphony plays you feel it you feel it in your heart and soul the unifi didnt do that for me but to be fair nothing with a speaker has done it for me eitherbr br im conflicted i love the sound of the elac unifi so much i really want it to work for me im considering buying the towers at twice the cost and a newused amp with watts per channel i dont know if the extra watts and extra woofers will create the dynamics or if ill be able to boost the treble enough to make these my forever speakersbr br my system two subwoofers cf enclosures loaded with dual inch woofers the subs are powered by a behringer inuke watts per sub my speakers are powered by a denon avr wattschohms my speakers are lcr monoprice passive pa speakers with compression horns ohm db efficient the monoprice speakers do not have the tonal character of the elac but boy oh boy do they have dynamics,2466

I had to reboot to even get it to recognize the hardware again. Then, as soon as anything needs to use the WiFi? Boom! Gone again.  Frustrated, I did a wipe and reset to factory. Same problems.  Only now, I don't get Windows 10 anymore because Microsoft decided to start charging for it.  But that's moot anyway, as I can't connect to the frigging net.

"Okay, I bought this item a while ago and was able to use it in various ways.  Two main purposes I use this for is to workout and when I ride my Harley Davidson.  It has an okay sound, not as high as I thought it would.  Using my Harley, being that it's loud, it doesn't have that full bass full volume sound.  But what really effects both my working out and my riding is the fact that the cord is not long enough.  I'm not a little guy.  I've been a gym rat for a long while so my neck is very thick.  My dress shirts are 18.5 (collar size).  And this is where my main issue lays with these headphones.  It becomes a bit tight and the cord moves either to the left or to the right a bit too much and it gets tight.  Also, when I take them off and place the magnetic part in front of me it is a bit tight and if I turn my head the come apart.  I've found that it's more comfortable to use them with the cord in front of me as appose to behind my head/neck.  But then I risk losing them easier.  As far as water resistant, they seem to be okay.  Obviously in the gym and riding my bike when it rains (few times cause I don't like riding when it rains).",3.0,okay i bought this item a while ago and was able to use it in various ways two main purposes i use this for is to workout and when i ride my harley davidson it has an okay sound not as high as i thought it would using my harley being that its loud it doesnt have that full bass full volume sound but what really effects both my working out and my riding is the fact that the cord is not long enough im not a little guy ive been a gym rat for a long while so my neck is very thick my dress shirts are collar size and this is where my main issue lays with these headphones it becomes a bit tight and the cord moves either to the left or to the right a bit too much and it gets tight also when i take them off and place the magnetic part in front of me it is a bit tight and if i turn my head the come apart ive found that its more comfortable to use them with the cord in front of me as appose to behind my headneck but then i risk losing them easier as far as water resistant they seem to be okay obviously in the gym and riding my bike when it rains few times cause i dont like riding when it rains,1098
"This screen is quite large. The fabric is very thin, which I suppose is so you can use a front or rear projector on it. The frame is made of thin plastic pipes, far less durable than pvc. It takes about 15-20 minutes for one person to assemble. It is not complicated, but there are lots of pieces to connect. The feet seem to support it fairly well, so i was not worried about it falling over. If you use it outdoors though, be aware that fully assembled it is still lightweight.

"&#34;Very good&#34; but not perfect. One of the Kindle's big selling point is the e-paper screen. This has one, but because Amazon uses it to monetize / put ads there, you can't actually use it for reading. Reading means turning it on and activating the backlight. It feels like a technical misstep: I never look at the screen when I'm NOT reading, so those ads are useless anyway. And it sacrifices one of the big selling points.<br /><br />Also, although it's a great reader, it's surprising to see it's still so slow like earlier versions. Browsing titles and using menus is clumsy.<br /><br />Once you start reading it's great. It just feels like two easy wins that were missed. A little disappointing.

"Since 2010, every time I’ve bought a new laptop, I’ve bought a new wireless mouse. I don’t like using the one on the laptop as it is too awkward and clunky for me.<br /><br />The mice I prefer – Logitech. The most recent one I got was: Logitech M317 – Amazon code B08L8SRJRR; white with purple/pink side grip, flowers on top. Though I did get it from Staples (the branding is shortened to Logi).<br /><br />To me, the brand doesn’t matter – I do try to keep my equipment the same, but the Logitech ones have never let me down. They’re also better shaped for my hand, though the ones of the last decade are smaller, which I LOVE. Last year when I got a new laptop for my birthday, I got the new little Logi listed above.<br /><br />I saw another HP mouse on here, the HP 930 Creator, and though that would be awesome. It wasn’t. I was quite disappointed. Not that I didn’t like my Logi, I though the HP would be a bit better. And, the 930 was over $67. Many problems, but the main one – size. Far too big for me in height and width.<br /><br />I saw this and thought it might be better than the 930 – was certainly simpler. I love the FLAT design. It’s about half the height of my Logi.<br /><br />This, like the 930 has a width problem, thus small hands and those with dexterity issues will have some problems “getting a grip”.<br /><br />Another issue with this – you need BLUETOOTH capabilities.<br /><br />Function?<br /><br />Connection: After turning on my computer’s BLUETOOTH, the mouse connected in under 5 minutes<br /><br />Sound: A bit quieter than my Logi, as well as the 930 Creator<br /><br />Scroll: A bit slower than the Logi, definitely slower than the 930<br /><br />Battery Replacement: Logi – on the bottom, like usual; 930 (rechargeable through USB). This? The battery is on the TOP. You have to remove the top black plate to put the battery in. This is the feature I dislike the most considering how THIN the plastic piece is. Depending on the amount of force used – it could easily get broken.<br /><br />Currently priced at $39.76, this is definitely a bit overpriced. I am not fond of it, and definitely wouldn’t get a replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of 3/26, the mouse keeps losing Bluetooth connectivity sometimes in as little as 15 minutes of non-use. I don't know if this is normal with the Bluetooth mouse, but it is definitely annoying especially when I have to reconnect.",3.0,since every time ive bought a new laptop ive bought a new wireless mouse i dont like using the one on the laptop as it is too awkward and clunky for mebr br the mice i prefer logitech the most recent one i got was logitech m amazon code blsrjrr white with purplepink side grip flowers on top though i did get it from staples the branding is shortened to logibr br to me the brand doesnt matter i do try to keep my equipment the same but the logitech ones have never let me down theyre also better shaped for my hand though the ones of the last decade are smaller which i love last year when i got a new laptop for my birthday i got the new little logi listed abovebr br i saw another hp mouse on here the hp creator and though that would be awesome it wasnt i was quite disappointed not that i didnt like my logi i though the hp would be a bit better and the was over many problems but the main one size far too big for me in height and widthbr br i saw this and thought it might be better than the was certainly simpler i love the flat design its about half the height of my logibr br this like the has a width problem thus small hands and those with dexterity issues will have some problems getting a gripbr br another issue with this you need bluetooth capabilitiesbr br functionbr br connection after turning on my computers bluetooth the mouse connected in under minutesbr br sound a bit quieter than my logi as well as the creatorbr br scroll a bit slower than the logi definitely slower than the br br battery replacement logi on the bottom like usual rechargeable through usb this the battery is on the top you have to remove the top black plate to put the battery in this is the feature i dislike the most considering how thin the plastic piece is depending on the amount of force used it could easily get brokenbr br currently priced at this is definitely a bit overpriced i am not fond of it and definitely wouldnt get a replacementbr br update as of the mouse keeps losing bluetooth connectivity sometimes in as little as minutes of nonuse i dont know if this is normal with the bluetooth mouse but it is definitely annoying especially when i have to reconnect,2172

"These are the best sounding ear buds I have tried so far and are certainly affordable.  There is no hiss when the noise canceling is on, as there often is in other models.  The audio is clear in all ranges and neither too bright nor too muddy.<br /><br />These come with silicone and memory foam tips - I don't find either comfortable but I have small ears and always have that problem.  I use Blue cell replacement tips (small) and then these are ok.  They are lighter weight than the other active noise canceling units I have tried, so they do stay in my ear better and that also helps with the comfort.  The sound isolation is not great with the tips that come with the unit, but I find that to be somewhat personal and a function of the shape of your ear.<br /><br />There is a lot of noise transfer with these - when you move, the unit transmits a lot of crackling sound.  It doesn't matter if you have the noise canceling on or off.<br /><br />I haven't been in an environment where I can test the active noise canceling function yet, so I will update when I test that out.<br /><br />For those who don't know - earbuds (and for that matter headphones) can reduce noise in 2 ways - active and passive.  Passive noise reduction is often called sound isolation and this is based  on physically blocking the sound from getting into your ear.  Active noise reduction, often called noise canceling, works by the unit recording the ambient sound and essentially producing an opposite wave form to cancel out the sound.  Noise canceling works best with certain types of sounds - predictable, constant sounds (like jet engine noise) etc.  It does not work very well to reduce ambient conversation, for example, so if that is what you are looking for, you will be disapointed.",3.0,these are the best sounding ear buds i have tried so far and are certainly affordable there is no hiss when the noise canceling is on as there often is in other models the audio is clear in all ranges and neither too bright nor too muddybr br these come with silicone and memory foam tips i dont find either comfortable but i have small ears and always have that problem i use blue cell replacement tips small and then these are ok they are lighter weight than the other active noise canceling units i have tried so they do stay in my ear better and that also helps with the comfort the sound isolation is not great with the tips that come with the unit but i find that to be somewhat personal and a function of the shape of your earbr br there is a lot of noise transfer with these when you move the unit transmits a lot of crackling sound it doesnt matter if you have the noise canceling on or offbr br i havent been in an environment where i can test the active noise canceling function yet so i will update when i test that outbr br for those who dont know earbuds and for that matter headphones can reduce noise in ways active and passive passive noise reduction is often called sound isolation and this is based on physically blocking the sound from getting into your ear active noise reduction often called noise canceling works by the unit recording the ambient sound and essentially producing an opposite wave form to cancel out the sound noise canceling works best with certain types of sounds predictable constant sounds like jet engine noise etc it does not work very well to reduce ambient conversation for example so if that is what you are looking for you will be disapointed,1690

"The lightweight iPad cover is not red, more of a hot pink color FYI.<br />I needed to replace my old iPad cover and since its an older model there weren't that many offerings left in the official Apple leather case division.

"[[VIDEOID:2e1e48afafe7261f888f4fa063c2dbdd]] I really like the fact that this is a larger display than the 7 inchers you usually find in car radio replacements. That's what initially attracted me to trying this unit, since my Toyota Solara's double din dash kit has tons of unused space to the right and left of the faceplate. The problem?<br />It's *slightly* too large vertically, and is centered instead of starting at the bottom. To explain: I measured my dashboard and realized it would stick up past the top and partially cover the bottom of my hazard button as well as the vents, but that's livable. I don't use the hazard button very often, and the vents can be adjusted away from it.  The problem is, it sticks out both top AND bottom, with the middle double-din sized part being centered in the display. That downward part concerns me because of my ability to turn the knobs for the climate control underneath. I wish that the unit started at the bottom of the double-din space and only went UP only. That's what I was expecting it to do, the way modern car radios have displays that stick out vertically but are flush with the dash underneath. I'm not ok with it rubbing against the climate knobs.<br />I took a video of trying to install it on my dash kit before I gave up and put it back in the box. I DID hook it up to 12v power just to see it turn on and make sure everything works, and I have to say it's a shame because this LOOKS really cool. I love that it runs Android and has all the customization I'd crave from a system like that. Android Auto is a treat too. I didn't hook up any speakers so I can't vouch for sound quality and I can't vouch for the longevity of the unit since I didn't actually keep it in my car, but it looks like a pretty good value for the money if this fits your dash layout.",3.0,videoideeafafefffacdbdd i really like the fact that this is a larger display than the inchers you usually find in car radio replacements thats what initially attracted me to trying this unit since my toyota solaras double din dash kit has tons of unused space to the right and left of the faceplate the problembr its slightly too large vertically and is centered instead of starting at the bottom to explain i measured my dashboard and realized it would stick up past the top and partially cover the bottom of my hazard button as well as the vents but thats livable i dont use the hazard button very often and the vents can be adjusted away from it the problem is it sticks out both top and bottom with the middle doubledin sized part being centered in the display that downward part concerns me because of my ability to turn the knobs for the climate control underneath i wish that the unit started at the bottom of the doubledin space and only went up only thats what i was expecting it to do the way modern car radios have displays that stick out vertically but are flush with the dash underneath im not ok with it rubbing against the climate knobsbr i took a video of trying to install it on my dash kit before i gave up and put it back in the box i did hook it up to v power just to see it turn on and make sure everything works and i have to say its a shame because this looks really cool i love that it runs android and has all the customization id crave from a system like that android auto is a treat too i didnt hook up any speakers so i cant vouch for sound quality and i cant vouch for the longevity of the unit since i didnt actually keep it in my car but it looks like a pretty good value for the money if this fits your dash layout,1746

"I bought mine direct from Samsung and ultimately returned them. I found that I had to fiddle with them constantly to hit the sweet spot for the music to sound like it should instead of like I was listening through a tin can, and while fiddling with them the touch controls become an annoying hassle because you are trying to get the fit right and the music is turning on and off and pausing and skipping, etc, because you are touching them. The buds can't seem to differentiate at all between an actual hold/grip to manipulate them in your ears, and a tap as you would do to actually use a touch control feature.<br /><br />Don't quote me on this because it's not like I counted every review that appeared male vs female, but I found that they hurt and I think it might be because they were designed by somewhat larger-eared males.  I originally assumed the hurty issue was likely because they were designed by some 60 year old man engineer with huge ears (because ears grow our whole lives) and so they were only made to fit kind of older larger ears. I even wrote on my Samsung review that they should have made the fit for the age group of their customer. But now, reading these Amazon reviews, I am noticing that the people saying they fit great seem to mostly be male names and those saying they hurt seem to mostly be female-normative names, so I still think they were designed for larger ears, but maybe for males they will fit better - I truly don't know how different in size male vs female ears are though; it's just a random observation of these reviews of hurt vs feel great.<br /><br />Bottom line, they hurt my ears and were too picky about being perfectly aligned in my ear.

I think this is a design flaw, when even my adult devices (except for Amazon devices) have a MICRO-C USB--which has no right way or upside down way. Why on earth would you make a device for kids like that? I know. Don't let them plug it in. You try telling a 5 year old who says, &#34;I can do it&#34; that &#34;No. You can't.&#34; Well, at 6, he's finally learned to plug it in and makes sure I know that there is an upside-down. Really, Amazon? Can't you fix this?",3.0,i bought this for my grandson years ago although it doesnt show as a verified purchase for some reason he loves it id give it a star rating if not for one complaint and its a big one the darned microb usb port the first year he had it he went through two chargers and had to have the tablet replaced once because of his little year old hands trying to force the stupid oneway cable into the little slot i think this is a design flaw when even my adult devices except for amazon devices have a microc usbwhich has no right way or upside down way why on earth would you make a device for kids like that i know dont let them plug it in you try telling a year old who says i can do it that no you cant well at hes finally learned to plug it in and makes sure i know that there is an upsidedown really amazon cant you fix this,821

"I'll start off with the good, This watch is quite comfortable to wear. Even though it's a bit on the large side, it's not super heavy on the wrist. The screen is quite bright and the touch sensitivity is just right. There are a wide variety of watch faces available within the app and the accompanying app is pretty easy to use and navigate. I also like that it integrates with Google Health system, that's super nice. The buttons work well and are quite tactile.<br /><br />What frustrates me are two things, navigation and customization. There are 3 different interaction mechanisms swipe side to side, a dial interface, and a sizeable 'system' menu that hides a lot of other function. It would be super nice to be able to customize which apps you see in the swipe left/right function, as the dial is a bit hard to accurately select the exact app you want to launch.

"I have a Kindle Keyboard, nee Kindle 3. I purchased the Kindle Touch as a ""lateral"" upgrade, since the Keyboard version is still currently in the same generation. So that will be the focus of my review.<br /><br />In short, if you have a Kindle Keyboard, don't bother upgrading.<br /><br />With the exception of the DX, I've owned every generation of the Kindle from the first, and have never been disappointed. For example, the difference between the K2 and K3 screens was immediately noticeable, and was well worth an upgrade.<br /><br />One of the marketing mantras from Amazon is that they want the ""Kindle to disappear in your hands"" or some such chant. This was true for every prior generation Kindle, but I'm not sure if this will be true of the Touch.<br /><br />The screen is deeply recessed, much more than prior versions, and if the reading light is not positioned properly, this deep recess will cause shadows. I figure the deeper recess is due to the addition of the touch mechanism. Unfortunately, which such a design point may seem small, this is one of the biggest negatives, as it has a direct impact on reading.<br /><br />I knew there was not going to be much of a major change between the Keyboard and the Touch, but I was ultimately interested in the smaller form factor of the Touch. Since I rarely used the keyboard, it is no loss, and rather a bonus.<br /><br />The power button remains in the same position, just near the USB connector, but they've changed it to a momentary push button, rather than the slider on the Keyboard. I've had the slider power switch on my Keyboard fail, necessitating a return to Amazon, and I've read other similar complaints, so I see this as a good thing. The only other button on the device is a square button at the bottom, which brings you to the home screen.<br /><br />Reading a book, the touch part works fine. Just tap the screen to advance pages. The screen refresh is different; on the Keyboard, the screen would refresh every page turn (that's the flash you see when changing pages), but on the Touch, it does not refresh every page. That makes page turning faster, and I hope will also give some additional battery life.<br /><br />While in the library, or in the Amazon Market (or your Archived Items), the touch method is a little different, as you need to use swipe gestures to page back and forth. If you've used a smart phone or tablet, you're probably used to such gestures, but be aware that the ""touch page turns"" is only applicable while reading a book.<br /><br />I also changed from a 3G Keyboard with no advertisements, to WiFi only with advertisements. I found myself disabling the 3G on the Keyboard, and since I don't travel, it won't be a loss. For those who ask, to disable 3G, simply configure WiFi. Once in range of a configured WiFi network, it'll use that over 3G.<br /><br />And with the new ""upgrade"" option allowing you to remove the advertisements, I figured this was a good chance to see if the advertisements are worth it. So far, no real opinion on that. They do eat up some screen space at the bottom of your library screen, which can be distracting if you're not used to it.<br /><br />The on-screen keyboard is fine, I have not had any real issues at all with it. Touching and dragging, to highlight phrases, takes a bit of patience, as it is a bit slow, and you may find yourself highlighting more than you intended. The built-in dictionary look-up is much improved over the Keyboard.<br /><br />Unlike the Keyboard, which has a progress bar at the bottom of the page, the progress bar is missing, instead being replaced with location and a percentage. I found the progress bar to be a great visual indicator, and I'm not sure if the percentage counter alone will be able to fit that feature.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I am indifferent to the Touch, compared to the Keyboard. If you have a Keyboard, I would say don't bother upgrading.<br /><br />If you're coming from a K1 or a K2, and can live without the keyboard, then definitely upgrade. Or if you're completely new to the Kindle family, then by all means, I'd say buy it.<br /><br />With a 30 day return policy, I am going to give the Touch a week or so before I ultimately consider returning it. I'd really like it to grow on me. In the meanwhile, I will not de-register my Keyboard, Just In Case.<br /><br />Edited on November 22: my Touch is on the way back to Amazon. The prior generations of the Kindle (the original, the Kindle 2 and then the Kindle 3) all generated insta-love. For me, the Touch didn't have it.",3.0,i have a kindle keyboard nee kindle i purchased the kindle touch as a lateral upgrade since the keyboard version is still currently in the same generation so that will be the focus of my reviewbr br in short if you have a kindle keyboard dont bother upgradingbr br with the exception of the dx ive owned every generation of the kindle from the first and have never been disappointed for example the difference between the k and k screens was immediately noticeable and was well worth an upgradebr br one of the marketing mantras from amazon is that they want the kindle to disappear in your hands or some such chant this was true for every prior generation kindle but im not sure if this will be true of the touchbr br the screen is deeply recessed much more than prior versions and if the reading light is not positioned properly this deep recess will cause shadows i figure the deeper recess is due to the addition of the touch mechanism unfortunately which such a design point may seem small this is one of the biggest negatives as it has a direct impact on readingbr br i knew there was not going to be much of a major change between the keyboard and the touch but i was ultimately interested in the smaller form factor of the touch since i rarely used the keyboard it is no loss and rather a bonusbr br the power button remains in the same position just near the usb connector but theyve changed it to a momentary push button rather than the slider on the keyboard ive had the slider power switch on my keyboard fail necessitating a return to amazon and ive read other similar complaints so i see this as a good thing the only other button on the device is a square button at the bottom which brings you to the home screenbr br reading a book the touch part works fine just tap the screen to advance pages the screen refresh is different on the keyboard the screen would refresh every page turn thats the flash you see when changing pages but on the touch it does not refresh every page that makes page turning faster and i hope will also give some additional battery lifebr br while in the library or in the amazon market or your archived items the touch method is a little different as you need to use swipe gestures to page back and forth if youve used a smart phone or tablet youre probably used to such gestures but be aware that the touch page turns is only applicable while reading a bookbr br i also changed from a g keyboard with no advertisements to wifi only with advertisements i found myself disabling the g on the keyboard and since i dont travel it wont be a loss for those who ask to disable g simply configure wifi once in range of a configured wifi network itll use that over gbr br and with the new upgrade option allowing you to remove the advertisements i figured this was a good chance to see if the advertisements are worth it so far no real opinion on that they do eat up some screen space at the bottom of your library screen which can be distracting if youre not used to itbr br the onscreen keyboard is fine i have not had any real issues at all with it touching and dragging to highlight phrases takes a bit of patience as it is a bit slow and you may find yourself highlighting more than you intended the builtin dictionary lookup is much improved over the keyboardbr br unlike the keyboard which has a progress bar at the bottom of the page the progress bar is missing instead being replaced with location and a percentage i found the progress bar to be a great visual indicator and im not sure if the percentage counter alone will be able to fit that featurebr br the bottom line is that i am indifferent to the touch compared to the keyboard if you have a keyboard i would say dont bother upgradingbr br if youre coming from a k or a k and can live without the keyboard then definitely upgrade or if youre completely new to the kindle family then by all means id say buy itbr br with a day return policy i am going to give the touch a week or so before i ultimately consider returning it id really like it to grow on me in the meanwhile i will not deregister my keyboard just in casebr br edited on november my touch is on the way back to amazon the prior generations of the kindle the original the kindle and then the kindle all generated instalove for me the touch didnt have it,4317

"This has lots of nice little bells and whistles, and if I hadn't been looking specifically for a good ultra-zoom lightweight camera I probably would be happy. The color is nice. It has lots of modes, but I found that I couldn't really use aperture priority or shutter priority if the light was low, it would tell me to open the flash, so I had to use manual.  The automatic modes are nice, you even have in-camera HDR and panorama mode.  I played with the panorama mode a bit for the fun of it. The macro mode is really a closeup mode, not real macro.  But the main falling point is the ultra zoom. It really doesn't give you 1200mm.  You have to lower the megapixels per shot to get more zoom, resulting in a fuzzier and fuzzier picture.  No 16mp shots at 1200mm.  I think you might get it at .03 mp, the smallest number. I went down to 3mp, and got fuzzy pictures at 108x (120 x is the maximum range of the lens).

"When it works it's great. But... the first one I got could not be activated by Comcast. It was refurbished by seller and Comcast's system reported that the MAC number was for a different model number. I spent at least 3 hours on the phone with Comcast trying to get this cleared up to no avail. I think the refurbisher mixed and matched parts from different models.<br /><br />Second one worked perfectly. Got it activated for internet using the comcast website. Not a hint of a problem. The telephone function didn't activate on the website though. I called and got someone good (after maybe 6 or 7 service calls to Comcast I know the difference and not many of the others were remotely good). He got my phone up and running in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's the modem or Comcast (I'm a new comcast internet user), but there does seem to be an inordinate amount of latency on the connection. Speed is good, much better than the DLS line I had been using, but there is a latency lag that approaches annoying, even extremely annoying, at times. Could be a fact of life with comcast or could be the modem. I don't know.<br /><br />In any case, we can stream anything on multiple machines, something we couldn't do on our DSL using AT&T's antiquated copper, so I'm happy.<br /><br />If you decide to buy your own modem instead of paying comcast, be aware that comcast is no fun to deal with on the phone -- but you already knew that, didn't you?

"I'm not sure where to start this review. First of all, the boxes containing all the equipment were sealed as tight as Fort Knox and it took forever to open them. I wish now I would have simply ripped the boxes open. Installation of the cameras is not difficult. We ran the wires through our attic and the cameras were easily mounted onto the soffitt. Note: these cameras must be mounted from the top and not the side or the image will be turned. Setting the DVR up locally was a piece of cake. You plug in all the wires to the back of the DVR, turn it on, and the cameras are up and running. The images are clear, the cameras record fine, even at night. Bugs flying in front of the cameras will start the recording process. We are still fine tuning the settings to block out moving tree limbs and shrubs. You can set the sensitivity of each camera as well as adjust the color.<br /><br />Our first problem was trying to hook the DVR up to our HD TV. Our TV has no VGA outlet, so we purchased a HDMI converter, which added to the cost. One of the features of this system is remote access to view your cameras from the internet -- anywhere in the world they say -- or on your smartphone. After several calls to Tech Support (and holding for over 30 minutes each time), we could not get the system to work remotely. We learned a few things. The system uses Port 80. Check with your ISP because most of them block Port 80 (some may unblock it for a monthly fee). There is a working way around this on another port, but you must use a PC computer for this. They don't tell you this on their website nor is it in the manual. (The system will work fine on a Mac locally but it must use Port 80 for remote access.)<br /><br />After 90 minutes with Tech Support on the last call, they were unable to get the email set up to work. You hate it when a tech person says, ""I don't know why this isn't working."" He had taken control of the computer and DVR and was setting this up. Basically, we've spent approximately 6 hours on the phone between Night Owl, our ISP and the manufacturer of our router (each blaming the other) trying to get this system to work properly -- and it's still not working the way this system should.<br /><br />I will give kudos to their Pro app because the setup works flawlessly on our smartphones. You can snap pictures from the cameras, save the video, manage your DVR from your phone. You will need to make sure you're using a wi-fi connection since the data runs constantly.<br /><br />The manual that comes with this system is very basic. There is a lot of missing information that you find out only after you've had to call them. If you've got the IT skills, you're still going to encounter problems. And the cameras have to be already installed in order to set everything else up, so it's too late to pull the wires back out, unmount the cameras, box it all up, and ship it back.<br /><br />We're still ironing out the bugs and hope to eventually get things set up to where all the features work the way they should.

"As is clearly stated in the product description and other reviews, there are no threads in bottom plate's hole.  I thought I could get around this by drilling into said hole with a 3/8 drill bit to create threads, then screwing in a 3/8 to 1/4 20 thread adapter bushing.

"I've purchased 3 of these Wasabi BP-827 replacement batteries for my Canon Vixia HG21 Camcorder so far.<br />They've all died within a year unfortunately.  I see all the glowing reviews for this battery, but honestly, I haven't seen a review from a customer who have used their battery for more than just a month, or even more than just a couple of days for that matter.

"Other reviewers have pointed out that the case of this power strip is metal. That is correct. Unfortunately, the metal appears to be aluminum and not steel, which is much stronger and resistant to damage. It is also much heavier, which makes it more expensive to ship from countries like China, which is where I assume this product originates. Unfortunately, I have no clue as to where it is actually made as there is no identifying information in the box at all.

I do not see any type of warranty that comes with the item, not that it would matter, since there is no way to contact the manufacturer.<br /><br />I do not see any circuit breaker and I seriously doubt that there is a replaceable fuse inside, so the product does not appear to have any type of surge protection, current limiting or noise filters.

"I've had the Dell Inspiron 17R (500 gig hard drive; 4 gigs RAM; i5-2410m processor) for about a month. I upgraded it to 6 gigs of RAM.<br /><br />The Inspiron is a pretty good value.  You get a lot of machine for the money.  The i5-2410m processor is fast.  Combined with the large amount of RAM, it'll handle with ease any normal, everyday task, such as watching movies, browsing, word processing, home video editing, and so on.  I can't speak to whether it'd be suitable for gaming, because I don't use it for that. However, it is quite a powerful laptop for routine computer stuff.<br /><br />I have seen the screen criticized elsewhere, for not being super-high resolution, but I disagree.  The 17.3"" screen is one of the high points of this laptop.  It is bright, sharp, and easy to read.  I've always been a fan of ""desktop replacement"" laptops, and have several over the years, always with a 17"" screen. I think this is one of the better screens out there.  It's 1600x900, which is not 1920x1080, but it's still very sharp, and the Inspiron 17R is half the price of a 1920x1080 laptop.<br /><br />It comes with a nice mix of ports. Two USB 3.0, a USB 2.0, and an extremely useful eSATAe.  The USB3.0 ports are not providing the kind of performance I was hoping for.  I think that either the laptop or my external drives are not configured properly to take advantage of USB3.0.  I'm getting USB3.0 speeds that are little better than USB2.0.  On the other hand, the eSATAe port is blazin' fast.  I plan just to use the eSATAe port and not bother with the 3.0 ports.<br /><br />My main complaint with this laptop is the mouse pad.  There are some laptops out there that have a mouse which jumps around too much.  This is one of them. Many other laptops do not have this problem anymore; it was a design problem that was fixed over the years.  So, what does this problem entail?  When you're typing, the cursor will occasionally jump elsewhere on the screen, and if you're not careful, you can end up deleting important text.  And, as another reviewer noted, there's the occasional related problem of the mouse-pointer sort of pinning itself to the right side of the screen; when this happens, nothing you do on the mousepad will unstick it, and you just have to fuss with it and, ultimately, wait for it to decide to start working again.  Experimenting with the mouse pad controls (sensitivity and speed, in Control Panel) helps a little, but not a lot. Fundamentally, it is just a bad mouse pad, something that should have been addressed by Dell and put to rest a long, long time ago.  The cursor-jumpiness around the screen is just unacceptable on a modern laptop.  The keyboard itself is mediocre; it has nice chicklet-style keys that are easy to type on, but they occasionally miss a letter when they shouldn't.  I spilled just a couple of drops of Diet Coke on one key, and now that key and six surrounding keys have permanent pop-and-crackle noises when I touch them.  Many (in fact, ""most"" or ""all"") other laptop keyboards are more mishap-tolerant than the one in the 17R. I want to love this laptop, but I have to say that laptops from other brands such as Toshiba have much better keyboards and mouse pads.<br /><br />The battery life is poor.  It is the shortest battery life I have ever experienced on a laptop.  You can get about 90 minutes if you are doing light browsing.  Any sort of heavy usage, like movie-watching, will put you down in the 60 to 75 minute range.  I really don't get that.  I've had other 17"" monitor laptops that ran for 2.5 to 3.5 hours between charges.  It doesn't bother me much, because I use it at home, where it's plugged in.  If I was in more of a road-warrior mode, I would've already returned it.  This laptop basically needs to be plugged in when you're using it.  It is also very heavy - substantially heavier than my last couple of 17"" laptops.  It really is not designed for road use, either in battery usage or weight; it's truly an old-school desktop replacement laptop.<br /><br />In summary: for the price, you get a lot of laptop with Dell.  The Inspiron 17R has a beautiful screen, a very fast processor, and ample storage and RAM for normal business or personal use.  I don't think for the $600 to $700 (depending on configuration) you can get much more laptop elsewhere.  However, the mouse, and specifically the jumpiness of the mouse, truly sucks.  The keyboard is very low-end -- so low-end it's hard to believe Dell thought this was an acceptable component to put on a modern, $600 machine.  All in all, I give this laptop 3 stars.  I would like to see Dell really drill down on why their mousepads and keyboards are not up to the competition, and replace them with better parts.  I have a feeling this one will last about a year or two, and then I will probably replace it with a different brand.",3.0,ive had the dell inspiron r gig hard drive gigs ram im processor for about a month i upgraded it to gigs of rambr br the inspiron is a pretty good value you get a lot of machine for the money the im processor is fast combined with the large amount of ram itll handle with ease any normal everyday task such as watching movies browsing word processing home video editing and so on i cant speak to whether itd be suitable for gaming because i dont use it for that however it is quite a powerful laptop for routine computer stuffbr br i have seen the screen criticized elsewhere for not being superhigh resolution but i disagree the screen is one of the high points of this laptop it is bright sharp and easy to read ive always been a fan of desktop replacement laptops and have several over the years always with a screen i think this is one of the better screens out there its x which is not x but its still very sharp and the inspiron r is half the price of a x laptopbr br it comes with a nice mix of ports two usb a usb and an extremely useful esatae the usb ports are not providing the kind of performance i was hoping for i think that either the laptop or my external drives are not configured properly to take advantage of usb im getting usb speeds that are little better than usb on the other hand the esatae port is blazin fast i plan just to use the esatae port and not bother with the portsbr br my main complaint with this laptop is the mouse pad there are some laptops out there that have a mouse which jumps around too much this is one of them many other laptops do not have this problem anymore it was a design problem that was fixed over the years so what does this problem entail when youre typing the cursor will occasionally jump elsewhere on the screen and if youre not careful you can end up deleting important text and as another reviewer noted theres the occasional related problem of the mousepointer sort of pinning itself to the right side of the screen when this happens nothing you do on the mousepad will unstick it and you just have to fuss with it and ultimately wait for it to decide to start working again experimenting with the mouse pad controls sensitivity and speed in control panel helps a little but not a lot fundamentally it is just a bad mouse pad something that should have been addressed by dell and put to rest a long long time ago the cursorjumpiness around the screen is just unacceptable on a modern laptop the keyboard itself is mediocre it has nice chickletstyle keys that are easy to type on but they occasionally miss a letter when they shouldnt i spilled just a couple of drops of diet coke on one key and now that key and six surrounding keys have permanent popandcrackle noises when i touch them many in fact most or all other laptop keyboards are more mishaptolerant than the one in the r i want to love this laptop but i have to say that laptops from other brands such as toshiba have much better keyboards and mouse padsbr br the battery life is poor it is the shortest battery life i have ever experienced on a laptop you can get about minutes if you are doing light browsing any sort of heavy usage like moviewatching will put you down in the to minute range i really dont get that ive had other monitor laptops that ran for to hours between charges it doesnt bother me much because i use it at home where its plugged in if i was in more of a roadwarrior mode i wouldve already returned it this laptop basically needs to be plugged in when youre using it it is also very heavy substantially heavier than my last couple of laptops it really is not designed for road use either in battery usage or weight its truly an oldschool desktop replacement laptopbr br in summary for the price you get a lot of laptop with dell the inspiron r has a beautiful screen a very fast processor and ample storage and ram for normal business or personal use i dont think for the to depending on configuration you can get much more laptop elsewhere however the mouse and specifically the jumpiness of the mouse truly sucks the keyboard is very lowend so lowend its hard to believe dell thought this was an acceptable component to put on a modern machine all in all i give this laptop stars i would like to see dell really drill down on why their mousepads and keyboards are not up to the competition and replace them with better parts i have a feeling this one will last about a year or two and then i will probably replace it with a different brand,4487

"I've had this now for several weeks and have used this side by side with my Navigon.  Living in Northern Virginia, traffic can be a problem, and changing routes is very normal.  With the Nextar SNAP5, I can be miles down the road before it kicks in with another route.  More disconcerting is  driving East on I-66 in Falls Church, and having the voice tell me I am going West.  When signage tells me I'm going a direction, the compass tells me I'm going in that same direction and the GPS voice tells me differently, I panic and want to pull off the road but I know better.  This system is large in screen, but that screen displays many icons and a map that is eclipsed by the Navigon 4.3 smaller size in package.  Startup is much faster in the Navigon than the Nextar SNAP5 under the exact same conditions, as I turn them on at the same time in the same place and wait for the navigation to begin.  It has taken me in very complicated and inefficient routes which would make Euler roll in his grave.  The text to voice function is less clear than the Navigon and the voice often breaks in and out with delivery, making the words unrecognizable.  I do not like the coiled cable at all, but do like the placement of the connection better than the one on the Navigon.  The map representation on the screen is unappealing and difficult to read in either option available and it's extremely difficult to see during bright days.  I sometimes cannot identify the map at all, regardless of how I position and reposition the device.  I have not used the MP3 function and never will, so that's wasted on me.  The POI's are nicely organized and it's interesting to find spots from a database that is very outdated which haven't existed for years.  It's a great concept if it is current but otherwise is a waste of time and can cause problems if you head to a spot that doesn't exist.  I do not know if updates are available as they are (with subscription purchase) for the Navigon.  This also does not have a traffic update availability as does the Navigon.  Since I don't use it without power from the vehicle, I cannot comment upon the battery life.  A stylus is included, but I also haven't used that expect in a rare occasion.  The carrying case is nice if you want to carry it, but I have yet to use the case.  Very nice to have a power cord to charge it away from the car.  All in all, the price of less than a hundred and a half is reasonable if you want the MP3 function but for me, I much prefer the Navigon.",3.0,ive had this now for several weeks and have used this side by side with my navigon living in northern virginia traffic can be a problem and changing routes is very normal with the nextar snap i can be miles down the road before it kicks in with another route more disconcerting is driving east on i in falls church and having the voice tell me i am going west when signage tells me im going a direction the compass tells me im going in that same direction and the gps voice tells me differently i panic and want to pull off the road but i know better this system is large in screen but that screen displays many icons and a map that is eclipsed by the navigon smaller size in package startup is much faster in the navigon than the nextar snap under the exact same conditions as i turn them on at the same time in the same place and wait for the navigation to begin it has taken me in very complicated and inefficient routes which would make euler roll in his grave the text to voice function is less clear than the navigon and the voice often breaks in and out with delivery making the words unrecognizable i do not like the coiled cable at all but do like the placement of the connection better than the one on the navigon the map representation on the screen is unappealing and difficult to read in either option available and its extremely difficult to see during bright days i sometimes cannot identify the map at all regardless of how i position and reposition the device i have not used the mp function and never will so thats wasted on me the pois are nicely organized and its interesting to find spots from a database that is very outdated which havent existed for years its a great concept if it is current but otherwise is a waste of time and can cause problems if you head to a spot that doesnt exist i do not know if updates are available as they are with subscription purchase for the navigon this also does not have a traffic update availability as does the navigon since i dont use it without power from the vehicle i cannot comment upon the battery life a stylus is included but i also havent used that expect in a rare occasion the carrying case is nice if you want to carry it but i have yet to use the case very nice to have a power cord to charge it away from the car all in all the price of less than a hundred and a half is reasonable if you want the mp function but for me i much prefer the navigon,2421

"I switch between a Logitech M570 (thumb trackball) and a Logitech MX Master 3 (regular mouse) daily, so I couldn’t help but compare the ProtoArc Trackball to the devices I use daily. For me, it’s not a worthy replacement. It’s a backup mouse, or one to take traveling with me when I’m worried my favorite mice might get damaged or lost.<br /><br />I do really like the adjustable angle of the mouse itself. The base allows you to set the mouse at 0 degrees or 20 degrees. That feature drew me to the trackball, and I think it’s implemented well. The mouse is rock steady at 0 or 20 degrees, but it’s easy to switch between the options. And because it’s built in, there are no extra parts to carry or worry about losing. For me, the 20 degree angle feels very natural, and that’s the one thing I miss when I go back to my usual mice.<br /><br />The trackball itself feels sluggish and inconsistent. I’ve tried adjusting the DPI, but that’s not the problem. Sometimes the ball registers the movement of my thumb and sometimes it doesn’t. I did check the ball and sensors; they are clean. The ball is actually hard to pop out, I needed to stick a pen through the small hole to get it out.<br /><br />The left and right click are soft and muted sounding.

"As far as basic function, it's fine. I bought a clock radio and that's what I got. HOWEVER... there were 2 main things I cared about - radio alarm (win) and the ability to dim the clock (fail).

"It does what I bought it for: provide network storage. I've tried a few packages as well (Synology Notes & Office mainly), but find the additional software packages rather disappointing, but again, I didn't buy it for that. I run the NAS with two 14TB Toshiba drives as well as two Samsung 980 NVME M.2 drives as cache. Performance is excellent in that setup.<br /><br />The main reasons for ""just"" a three star rating at:<br /><br />1) The build quality is seriously cheap. It's a cheap plastic housing that amplifies the rattling noise from a seeking drive. The slides are pure plastic and if you plan to use these often, there is a good likelihood you'll break one. The doors on the SSD slots are cheapo plastic as well and the drives themselves are held in with plastic clips that feel likely to break. I don't plan to change my drives in the next few years and I'm not planning on touching the NVME drives either, so it's not a big issue for me, but I'm REALLY disappointed in the overall feel of the housing.<br /><br />2) The additional software is not great (this is on DSM7.1). As soon as I installed some of the packages (namely Notes and Office, both Synology products) the NAS woke the HDDs from Hibernation every 20 to 30 minutes – like clockwork actually. I had to remove all installed packages to get HDD hibernation back and even now it's not reliable, even when I disconnect the network and have no tasks configured It only wakes up every few hours now, so it's tolerable. The quality of the Notes package is meh, every cheap notes app you get on any of the relevant app stores is MILES ahead. Cannot recommend. The office package might be usable for some, but it doesn't work well for me. I'll keep to either actual Office documents (MS Office, Apple Apps, ...) on the NAS drives or just use Google docs.<br /><br />3) The available logs in the interface are pretty much useless. I was trying to debug the HDD hibernation issue and it was just trial and error. If I find a log entry telling me the drive had to be started, I'd also expect a REASON (e.g. client connect, web connect, WOL, whatever – just give me SOMETHING).<br /><br />4) I wish it had 2.5Gbit/s ethernet. It's okay for me, but we are only two people working in the network, so the load is low, but I still wish I could saturate fast drives (e.g. if cached to/from NVME drive) – come on, I have two 1TB cache drives in there, these could actually be used better.<br /><br />5) The RAM is on the low side. I recommend getting a RAM module (still waiting for mine). I have hit high memory utilization a few time with just playing around, not even a single docker container running. Starting out with 2GB is just a bit too low. 4GB would be great, especially if it was a removable module (which it isn't as far as I know).<br /><br />Reasons why it's still good and why I'm reasonably happy with it:<br /><br />1) File transfers are very reliable, zero issues there. I still have to test out encryption, but I don't expect too much trouble since the CPU can handle it and the network interface is slow anyways.<br /><br />2) It supports all the protocols I need (SMB, AFP, NFS).<br /><br />3) As silly as it sounds, but I like the fact that I can dim the LEDs and even turn them off based on a schedule.<br /><br />So, overall a decent NAS, but if you are thinking of buying today, I'd wait for the next generation. Maybe that one has 2.5Gbit ethernet.",3.0,it does what i bought it for provide network storage ive tried a few packages as well synology notes office mainly but find the additional software packages rather disappointing but again i didnt buy it for that i run the nas with two tb toshiba drives as well as two samsung nvme m drives as cache performance is excellent in that setupbr br the main reasons for just a three star rating atbr br the build quality is seriously cheap its a cheap plastic housing that amplifies the rattling noise from a seeking drive the slides are pure plastic and if you plan to use these often there is a good likelihood youll break one the doors on the ssd slots are cheapo plastic as well and the drives themselves are held in with plastic clips that feel likely to break i dont plan to change my drives in the next few years and im not planning on touching the nvme drives either so its not a big issue for me but im really disappointed in the overall feel of the housingbr br the additional software is not great this is on dsm as soon as i installed some of the packages namely notes and office both synology products the nas woke the hdds from hibernation every to minutes like clockwork actually i had to remove all installed packages to get hdd hibernation back and even now its not reliable even when i disconnect the network and have no tasks configured it only wakes up every few hours now so its tolerable the quality of the notes package is meh every cheap notes app you get on any of the relevant app stores is miles ahead cannot recommend the office package might be usable for some but it doesnt work well for me ill keep to either actual office documents ms office apple apps on the nas drives or just use google docsbr br the available logs in the interface are pretty much useless i was trying to debug the hdd hibernation issue and it was just trial and error if i find a log entry telling me the drive had to be started id also expect a reason eg client connect web connect wol whatever just give me somethingbr br i wish it had gbits ethernet its okay for me but we are only two people working in the network so the load is low but i still wish i could saturate fast drives eg if cached tofrom nvme drive come on i have two tb cache drives in there these could actually be used betterbr br the ram is on the low side i recommend getting a ram module still waiting for mine i have hit high memory utilization a few time with just playing around not even a single docker container running starting out with gb is just a bit too low gb would be great especially if it was a removable module which it isnt as far as i knowbr br reasons why its still good and why im reasonably happy with itbr br file transfers are very reliable zero issues there i still have to test out encryption but i dont expect too much trouble since the cpu can handle it and the network interface is slow anywaysbr br it supports all the protocols i need smb afp nfsbr br as silly as it sounds but i like the fact that i can dim the leds and even turn them off based on a schedulebr br so overall a decent nas but if you are thinking of buying today id wait for the next generation maybe that one has gbit ethernet,3193
"When I first purchased the Kindle Paperwhite, I did so because I had an older Kindle (keyboard version) and some of the letters on the keyboard ceased working.  I did a lot of research before I traded in my old Kindle.  I really liked the reviews on the new Paperwhite version so decided to purchase it.  I had to replace my first Paperwhite because the refresh screen turned every screen black.  Customer service was excellent and when it was determined that we could not reset the kindle I received a new one.  I waited until now to write this review (it was purchased earlier this year) because there were many differences and wanted to make sure that the review gave the Kindle what I felt it deserved.<br /><br />First, I must say that I love many of the features of the Paperwhite version: it is small enough to fit in my purse, the font is easy on the eyes, the back-light is great in any light, the dictionary feature works well and I love the fact it has a vocabulary builder.  It is very easy to download books and to access my library; it is also easy to locate different pages in the book.<br /><br />However, the reason I rated the PaperWhite a 3 is because of the page turning (I have had no further problems with the refresh).  Sometimes with light touch it will not turn the page or it will skip 3 or 4 pages and you have to back up to your last read page, which I find very annoying.  I had more control with my older Kindle as it had a button on the side that allowed you to control the page turns and wish that the Paper White had the same feature.  Other than this, the Paper White has a lot of great features but I am very disappointed with the page turn function.",3.0,when i first purchased the kindle paperwhite i did so because i had an older kindle keyboard version and some of the letters on the keyboard ceased working i did a lot of research before i traded in my old kindle i really liked the reviews on the new paperwhite version so decided to purchase it i had to replace my first paperwhite because the refresh screen turned every screen black customer service was excellent and when it was determined that we could not reset the kindle i received a new one i waited until now to write this review it was purchased earlier this year because there were many differences and wanted to make sure that the review gave the kindle what i felt it deservedbr br first i must say that i love many of the features of the paperwhite version it is small enough to fit in my purse the font is easy on the eyes the backlight is great in any light the dictionary feature works well and i love the fact it has a vocabulary builder it is very easy to download books and to access my library it is also easy to locate different pages in the bookbr br however the reason i rated the paperwhite a is because of the page turning i have had no further problems with the refresh sometimes with light touch it will not turn the page or it will skip or pages and you have to back up to your last read page which i find very annoying i had more control with my older kindle as it had a button on the side that allowed you to control the page turns and wish that the paper white had the same feature other than this the paper white has a lot of great features but i am very disappointed with the page turn function,1629

"I had already installed the PXAMG interface to allow me to plug my iPod into the car's audio system.<br /><br />When the factory Acura Bluetooth Handsfreelink transceiver failed and I could no longer make or answer my iPhone 4 handsfree (without spending $700 at the dealer!) I installed this ISBT21 Bluetooth interface, hoping for the best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- excellent audio quality for streaming Bluetooth content from the iPhone 4 to the 2005 TL's (non-navi) factory radio<br />  * the ""2"" key on the radio becomes the pause/play button<br />  * the buttons on the steering wheel control next/previous track selection<br />- easy install:<br />  * a DIN plug easily inserts into an existing socket on the PXAMG<br />  * An external mic plugs into the ISBT21 that allows you to do voice commanded phone calls using the iPhone's voice recognition<br />- accesses all phone numbers on the phone (as opposed to Acura's Handsfreelink system that makes you ""teach"" the car each number manually...a real pain.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Incoming phone audio is way, WAY too loud and distorted. A note says to control incoming phone audio via the volume buttons on the phone. So if you are listening to the streaming content at a given volume and you make a phone call or somebody calls you, it's really annoying. You have to turn the radio's volume control down immediately and a lot to get it down to a reasonable volume. But the phone voice quality is still distorted. It's like the ISBT21 is not matching the impedance or something. Almost like jamming line level into a mic level input.<br />- Menu is dicey<br />  * When you want to adjust the outgoing mic volume or the incoming speaker volume, you press button 6 (supposedly) to display the menu. It may or may not do this. And the generic instructions that come with the unit simply don't reflect how my radio looks. Buttons they call out don't even exist on my radio. Bottom line: it's very clumsy to adjust the Settings.<br />- Fails to connect often<br />  * I get into the car and fire it up and it may or may not find my phone. I have to call up the phone's Settings/General/Bluetooth and click on the ""PhoneKit"" to get it to connect. This is after you have initially paired the unit, which is easy enough.<br />- Can't recognize my voice command that well<br /><br />I really, really wanted this to work. I'm sorry to say it's not there. My Panasonic DEH-7100BT aftermarket radio is terrific.<br /><br />No matter what I have done, I can't make the ISBT21's phone work to perfection.

"Everything about this dock is either confusing, misleading, or falsely. First of all, I’m not quite sure I see the point of having two hosts connect to it as I it does not seem to be a like a KVM switch in any way. For one, video output is dedicated to one or the other host depending on the port. There is no switch to toggle between hosts so USB devices seem to be shared? Honestly it’s not at all clear. The power supply also can only charge one host, I believe whichever is plugged in first. Since there is a single ethernet jack that both hosts share it also shares a single MAC ID. The only explanation for any of this seems to be to give a buyer some impression that it behaves like a KVM switch that allows you to share peripherals. In fact it’s not even clear what it does as the instructions are incomplete. Since I was unable to get a keyboard to work connected to it I presume can you either use the built-in keyboard or plug it directly into the laptop.<br /><br />I honestly didn’t even fully unboxed this thing after reading the instructions and trying to make sense of them. Once I saw that video was not shared and that the resolution was appallingly low, all of the other issues were already moot. It is advertised as a thunderbolt 3 dock but it’s apparent that thunderbolt 3 support is quite limited and it’s really a USB-C dock. Seeing how the function of this device is very unclear a pure its existence only serves to fool customers like me into not having to use a KVM.

"I have mixed feelings about this tablet.  First, the sound ranges from mediocre to terrible. The earphone jack is loose and has to be fix-one can only hear one side of the headphones unless one jiggles the jack.  Secondly, and more troublesome, is the repeated crashing of the tablet.  This requires a cold restart. This is never good to do to a device.  This is a KNOWN issue.<br />UPDATE: They stopped supporting any version<br />The camera is exceptional and people have asked if my pics were taken on a 35 mm or professionally.  The zoom feature is amazing; the lens does an amazing job of focusing close-ups and other difficult shots. It is versaile--from AudioBooks to music and the web. It pretty much functions like a tablet plus all the great Kindle features. The camera is better than the IPad, which I also have.  If you are going to get it, get the three year warranty. I will use it for my headphone jack. The help available through Mayday is great.  Imagine having a live person 24/7!  Their help has been fast and accurate.  There is virtually no wait time.  I usually need them when my tablet freezes--sometimes it is due to your cache being overfull. Remember to clear your dead files. This, they claim, will reduce freezes.<br /><br />TIP:<br />It is durable but a cover is essential. It is sleek. I also suggest a screen protective cover for about 10 bucks. I just saved my phone with one of these.  I caution against any cover with any magnetic closing feature. This will cause it to shut off.  It is really annoying. If the magnetic component hie screen, it shuts off.<br /><br />On a related note, I also have a seven inch, which is still going strong.  It is dummy proof and very handy. I have had it over four years....and when the battery died I found out that my 600.00 purchase could not be fixed. Come on Amazon! You can’t replace a battery?

"This Bluetooth picks up sounds from near and far away and actually amplifies them to the person on the other end, instead of cancelling those sounds out like it's supposed to. I would not recommend this Bluetooth. My boyfriend is a merchant marine officer and works long distance on a boat for a month at a time, so I like to use my Bluetooth to talk to him while he's away at work on his boat, but I can only use this Bluetooth when I'm in very quiet surroundings, otherwise he can hear every little sound amplified (even sounds that I can barely hear myself). The only thing I like about this Bluetooth is the voice command to answer a call, however I am disappointed that it does not say who is calling when it notifies you that you have an incoming call. I wish it would say &#34;Incoming call from John Doe, Answer or Ignore?&#34; But all it says is &#34;Incoming call, Answer or Ignore?&#34; Then you have to go to your phone, pick it up, and look at it, to see who is calling, which defeats the whole purpose of this feature.

"I'm going to try and ignore the fact that this thing literally damaged my person and try to be as unbiased as possible here...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- strong adhesive (also see cons)<br />- doesn't look awful? Really, I'm coming up dry, here...<br /><br />Cons:<br />- strong adhesive<br />- weak joint<br /><br />Okay, let me explain. At first, the strong adhesive was definitely a pro. I peeled off the paper to reveal the adhesive, and stuck the plate to the wall. Easy, right? So part of the test, of course, is... what happens when you need to remove it? You get something that's adhesive, and not making holes in your wall, because you want to be able to take it off! Maybe you're a renter? Maybe you want to be able to move it? This adhesive did more damage to my RENTED wall than any screw ever could. It absolutely destroyed my wall, which I now have to repair. And the adhesive was already on the plate and I couldn't peel it off, so it's not like I could replace it with another brand of adhesive or a more trusted nano tape or something. AND, now that the adhesive is now covered in paint and drywall, the whole thing is useless to even move to another place.<br /><br />Not to mention--the plate that sticks to the wall... the edges are RAZOR SHARP. Even though I used a tool to get the removal started, I didn't realize until seeing red streaks on my clothes, that the edges of the plate had bit into my fingertips and done some damage.<br /><br />The other con is that the joint between the sticking plate and the actual part that holds your phone/tablet is just a piece of rubber. It was fine holding my phone, but anything heaver than that, like my ipad, and the joint would sloooowly give and the holder would droop and eventually drop my ipad. Not something you want to have happen with an expensive piece of technology.<br /><br />This is the absolute worst thing I've gotten on Amazon in a long time.<br /><br />Does it stick to the wall? Yes.

The listing indicates that this is an auto-focus (AF) lens. The box and the documentation that came all indicated that it was an AF lens. The actual lens itself was not an AF lens. I don't know if this was just a mistake on someones part (accidentally put the wrong lens in the box) or what. I was very disappointed. I ended up returning it and purchasing the [[ASIN:B000O161X0 Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Zoom Nikkor Lens]] for $65 more and I am very happy with it.

"I had a Samsung BL103 for awhile and it was my first digital camera.  I loved it!  But when the autofocus died, I figured I'd just get a new camera than pay well over the original price to get it fixed.  I found this camera and thought it was great!  At first.

When I put on the wall plate after installing this adapter plate, I noticed that the wall plate was protruding from the wall on the side of this adapter causing a large gap to be seen. I removed the adapter plate and used a grinder to remove all of the plastic material that is built up around the screw hole that secures the wall plate.

"I am a big fan of Canon cameras, however this time I was very disappointed. I read the reviews about this camera and I thought I will get another great Canon product. But after using it for several months now, I have to say, I am very, very disappointed with this camera. This camera is a great example that smaller is not necessarily better. Yes, this camera is small and handy, it is sturdy (I dropped it onto concrete floor, not a scratch) and it has great features. HOWEVER, the quality of the pictures is bad. The flash (because of the small size of the camera) is not strong enough, so your pictures are very dark. The pictures come out only have focused, especially the outer edges of the photos are always out of focus. The overall quality is just not what I expected. I had the Powershot 500 (Ixus 500) and it was a great camera with fantastic pictures. I will go out now and buy a new camera because this one is just not worth the money. I will shoot for the G9 or something like it. Is bigger but much better quality pictures.<br />My advise, don't go by the Megapixel, more is not always better.

"I have a problem with the way ALL surge protectors are designed. Why can't they add plates with holes on each end so we can screw them into or onto cabinets, under counters, etc.? I am disabled and cannot get down onto or up off the floor. I have to keep these on table tops so I can plug in the endless chargers necessitated by modern technology. Since tech companies can't be consistent in how they shape and size transformers (I use all Apple products, and they can't be consistent within their own company), we have to be creative to get even three plugs to fit into a six-outlet adapter. Then the stupid surge protector falls on the floor, and we have to fish it out from under and behind furniture, along with transformers/plugs that have all been pulled out and then do the whole jigsaw puzzle again.

WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ATTACH THEM TO/UNDER COUNTERS SO THEY STAY WHERE WE NEED THEM. How difficult is that for these brain trusts to figure out?

"I've had this product for 2-3 years and the frustration drove me to buy a different product today. The backlight for the clock is so bright we have to cover it with a stack of books or it even keeps my husband awake- and he sleeps on the opposite side of our king bed. This interferes with the remote functioning. However, even with everything correctly positioned, as others have said, you rarely get the response you desire from the remote without several mistakes.<br /><br />Try to get the volume up and if you're not careful, it maxes easily, then goes automatically to the lowest level and vice versa. Try to get a replay and generally nothing happens for the first few presses and then it goes back too far. If you try to turn on the iPod, half the time the radio initializes instead, because the same button initializes everything, switching from one mode to the other with each press. The problem is that half the presses do nothing, so you are left cycling around, wondering what function, if any, will initialize next. AM reception is nil, so when it cycles there, loud buzzing commences,  and FM reception is poor.<br /><br />It's difficult to access the click wheel while in the dock, so you have to sit down next to the unit to do anything besides just the regular play all feature. Then when you do mess with the iPod, you are likely to dislodge it, resulting in having to attempt to program your choices more than once. Too bad you can't just select your choices, then insert into the dock, but no, not that easy.<br /><br />I found the learning curve and the annoyance of the quick rise of the alarm volume completely discouraging, so I use the alarm on my phone instead. The buttons on the unit itself must be pressed very firmly to work, and the labeling is difficult to read, so I have to sit down beside the unit and put on my reading glasses to figure out what does what. My nano is difficult to set correctly in the cradle and is easily dislodged, which has caused no end of frustration when things suddenly stop working.<br /><br />I had a couple of Memorex CD players which were poor quality and I should have learned my lesson.

"UPDATE February 2019:  The latest software update eliminated most of the problems with hijacking my hearing aids and linking with my iPhone is now more reliable.  Unfortunately, it is now virtually impossible to connect to my MacBookPro unless I do a hard reboot of both laptop and headphones.  That makes the Bose phones useless for videoconferencing, listening to music via laptop, or pretty much anything headphones are routinely used for.  It appears that the software engineering at Bose continues to be second rate, and if problems aren't fixed a year after the product was sold - I fear that they never will.  This is the last Bose product I will consider...<br /><br />UPDATE December 2018:  None of the problems from my original review have been addressed by Bose despite multiple app updates.  The implementation of Bluetooth connection on these phones is poor and unreliable; the associated app features are terrible and non-functional.  Lowered review from three to two stars now that it's clear Bose is unable or unwilling to fix the fundamental problems with these phones.<br /><br />If you rarely use Bluetooth or only connect to one device, you might be satisfied with these 'phones.  If you have no intention of using Alexa or Google Assistant, the fact that they don't work won't bother you.  Otherwise, you will be disappointed in a Bose product that doesn't work as advertised.<br /><br />Until this purchase, I've been a loyal Bose fan for decades and went out of my way to pay extra for Bose quality.  In the future, I will think very carefully before purchasing anything else from Bose...<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Wrote a glowing review immediately after buying these headphones, but this has turned out to one of the worst Bose purchases I ever made.  First the good news: the sound and hardware seem to be as excellent as the Bose reputation.  I had to switch to over-ear phones now that I wear hearing aids and decided to go all out and pay extra for the wireless features, including Alexa compatibility.<br /><br />Ten months later, it's clear that the wireless features are so flawed that they're useless with my iPhone 6.  Like many, I experience sound drop outs for no apparent reason, but the most annoying hassle is that these phones are unable to connect reliably unless you manually reinstall them almost every time.  For many months, they defaulted to my Bluetooth hearing aids no matter what so all I heard was tinny voice frequencies without any bass at all.  I emailed Bose support on all my issues but they never responded.<br /><br />I can link the phones to my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and LG TV.  BUT, unless I manually turn off all but one option, these phones never synch after the initial connection.  Alexa control is a joke because it takes too long to find the app and carry out the option.  Google Assistant isn't much better but the software is clearly biased toward Google products so be forwarned.  I gave up on both after numerous trials and just manually open the app in my iPhone and manually change playlists or whatever else I need to do.  It's much faster and more reliable to use the wired connection, which works flawlessly, but defeats the purpose of buying the wireless capabilities.<br /><br />The connection seems a bit more stable after several iOS updates this year, but sometimes these phones become less stable after an update.  Don't tell me to skip the iOS 12 update: updates make my data more stable and my Apple devices more responsive.  Bose shouldn't advertise a product that's not functional with modern OS.<br /><br />Based on my experience and the lackluster Bose support, think twice before paying more for the Bluetooth versions of these phones.",2.0,update february the latest software update eliminated most of the problems with hijacking my hearing aids and linking with my iphone is now more reliable unfortunately it is now virtually impossible to connect to my macbookpro unless i do a hard reboot of both laptop and headphones that makes the bose phones useless for videoconferencing listening to music via laptop or pretty much anything headphones are routinely used for it appears that the software engineering at bose continues to be second rate and if problems arent fixed a year after the product was sold i fear that they never will this is the last bose product i will considerbr br update december none of the problems from my original review have been addressed by bose despite multiple app updates the implementation of bluetooth connection on these phones is poor and unreliable the associated app features are terrible and nonfunctional lowered review from three to two stars now that its clear bose is unable or unwilling to fix the fundamental problems with these phonesbr br if you rarely use bluetooth or only connect to one device you might be satisfied with these phones if you have no intention of using alexa or google assistant the fact that they dont work wont bother you otherwise you will be disappointed in a bose product that doesnt work as advertisedbr br until this purchase ive been a loyal bose fan for decades and went out of my way to pay extra for bose quality in the future i will think very carefully before purchasing anything else from bosebr br original reviewbr wrote a glowing review immediately after buying these headphones but this has turned out to one of the worst bose purchases i ever made first the good news the sound and hardware seem to be as excellent as the bose reputation i had to switch to overear phones now that i wear hearing aids and decided to go all out and pay extra for the wireless features including alexa compatibilitybr br ten months later its clear that the wireless features are so flawed that theyre useless with my iphone like many i experience sound drop outs for no apparent reason but the most annoying hassle is that these phones are unable to connect reliably unless you manually reinstall them almost every time for many months they defaulted to my bluetooth hearing aids no matter what so all i heard was tinny voice frequencies without any bass at all i emailed bose support on all my issues but they never respondedbr br i can link the phones to my iphone ipad macbook pro and lg tv but unless i manually turn off all but one option these phones never synch after the initial connection alexa control is a joke because it takes too long to find the app and carry out the option google assistant isnt much better but the software is clearly biased toward google products so be forwarned i gave up on both after numerous trials and just manually open the app in my iphone and manually change playlists or whatever else i need to do its much faster and more reliable to use the wired connection which works flawlessly but defeats the purpose of buying the wireless capabilitiesbr br the connection seems a bit more stable after several ios updates this year but sometimes these phones become less stable after an update dont tell me to skip the ios update updates make my data more stable and my apple devices more responsive bose shouldnt advertise a product thats not functional with modern osbr br based on my experience and the lackluster bose support think twice before paying more for the bluetooth versions of these phones,3563

"We bought one of these for video to use our existing Lowel Totas. Idea was to be able to transport and erect a large softlight on location. I love the stand adapter.

"Bought this camera for my 7 year old.  As a toy, it isn't bad.  However, if I were buying this for myself I would have been less than unsatisfied with this for the price.<br /><br />This camera is at best worth about $15.  NOT $70!<br /><br />It has no actual zoom.  Digital zoom only.  Which means less quality to the photo.<br /><br />It has no memory.  You cannot take and store a single photo on the camera.  You must purchase an SD card before you can use the camera.  SD card is NOT included.  (This isn't meant to be a good or bad review.  It is what it is.  The manufacturer can choose to include or not.  Just pointing this out so you are not caught off-guard when you receive it)<br /><br />There are some nice features to the camera but overall the camera is a very cheap and flimsy-feeling device.  Buttons and other controls feel like they could break easily.  This is the standard by which most ""Chinese products"" are made.<br /><br />I haven't tested the camera underwater yet.  That is one of the reasons I purchased this model for my child as a gift.  We like snorkeling and I hope this will work for that purpose.  So I will have to test this when we get the chance.<br /><br />As long as the camera performs under water like it is rated for, I think we will be ok with it for the purpose we purchased it for.  However, at this price, I would have expected a lot more quality in this camera.<br /><br />If you are looking to get what you pay for.... this isn't the camera to purchase.

"What I thought was going to be the perfect solution to run a firewire audio interface, a hard drive hub via eSATA, and a 4k monitor turned out be a frustrating experience.  It seems all of the problems originate when the computer goes to sleep and wakes back up.  Upon awaking, nothing works properly.  The 4k monitors lose all of their settings, i.e. scaling, arrangement, and wallpaper.  Also after awaking, the firewire and eSATA ports are no longer read / identified by the computer.<br /><br />To solve all of this, unplugging and replugging the power to the Akitio Thunder2 Dock seems to reset everything and the computer will again read the firewire and eSATA ports–however, the monitors need to be reconfigured each time.  None of this happens when I plug these devices in individually without the Dock, the computer sleeping and waking without issue.<br /><br />In short, this device will work as promised on initial power up.  Once the computer wakes after sleep, all of the issues arise. Because of this, you can't plug all of your devices into the Dock and just forget about it.  I will only be using the Thunder2 Dock when I specifically need certain ports, the rest of the time it is a paper weight.<br /><br />MacBook Pro 15"" 2.8GHz i7 Mid 2014 - Mojave 10.1.4<br />2 - ViewSonic 4k VX3211 Monitors<br />MOTU Traveler Firewire Audio Interface<br />ThermalTake Dual Bay eSATA Storage",2.0,what i thought was going to be the perfect solution to run a firewire audio interface a hard drive hub via esata and a k monitor turned out be a frustrating experience it seems all of the problems originate when the computer goes to sleep and wakes back up upon awaking nothing works properly the k monitors lose all of their settings ie scaling arrangement and wallpaper also after awaking the firewire and esata ports are no longer read identified by the computerbr br to solve all of this unplugging and replugging the power to the akitio thunder dock seems to reset everything and the computer will again read the firewire and esata portshowever the monitors need to be reconfigured each time none of this happens when i plug these devices in individually without the dock the computer sleeping and waking without issuebr br in short this device will work as promised on initial power up once the computer wakes after sleep all of the issues arise because of this you cant plug all of your devices into the dock and just forget about it i will only be using the thunder dock when i specifically need certain ports the rest of the time it is a paper weightbr br macbook pro ghz i mid mojave br viewsonic k vx monitorsbr motu traveler firewire audio interfacebr thermaltake dual bay esata storage,1298

"I live in hopes of finding bluetooth headphones to wear with my phone while walking my dogs or exercising so that I can listen to recorded books.

In other words it went back a few seconds in the recording.

"This is a nice little drone but Parrot updated their FreeFlight 3 app, now called FreeFlight Mini, and the camera button/ option is nowhere to be found on the new app for the Rolling Spider so the camera is no longer functional.

After I emailed them the product description from Parrot.com, Amazon.com, as well as a photo of the side of the box where it indicates that it does have a camera, they told me the camera button is on the upper right side of the control screen of the FreeFlight Mini app.  Literally went in a complete circle with them as the reason why I contacted them in the first place is because there is no camera button on the app, upper right side or anywhere else.

"Winegard has made some great TV antennas over the years. This is not one of them. With Radio Shack out of business Winegard and Channel Master seem to be one of the few old-school brand names still making TV antennas these days. The company has traditional manufactured both residential and commercial grade antennas that were built not only to last but to perform good enough to provide a broadcast quality picture. Their latest offering the Winegard ""Elite"" is quite a disappointment by comparison.<br /><br />The company seems to be taking advantage of the recent rush by consumers to ""upgrade"" their big, ugly outdoor antennas in favor of smaller, more compact ""cuter"" looking antennas. Let me make one thing perfectly clear... A larger, better constructed antenna will ALWAYS provide a better signal than a smaller one, regardless of price. If you have one of those huge eyesore antennas from Radio Shack that was installed in the 1970's hold on to it. There is no need to ""upgrade"". Those antennas work just as well for HD signals as newer models and will pull in far more stations than an antenna like this will.<br /><br />There is no such thing as an ""HD antenna"". Antennas do not know the difference between digital and analog. There is also no such thing as 4K TV, at least not here in the United States. Buying a newer antenna is not going to get you ANY 4K UHD programming because TV stations do not transmit in 4K. Period. I have no idea why Wingard is trying to pass off UHD reception as something that is possible.<br /><br />To say that the construction of this device is not up to Winegard's normal standards is a vast understatement. It's build quality is horrible. It's overwhelmingly made of cheap, plastic parts and antenna elements that are far too small to provide decent reception on the VHF band. I happen to live in an area where we still have a VHF Channel 3, and the reception on this is horrible, even with the built-in pre-amp.<br /><br />Why would anyone pay over $100 for such a cheap device that looks like a million other brands made in China? I have no clue. It's definitely not a good value proposition, nor is it any better built than it's cheaper Chinese counterparts. I suspect that the pre-amp likely performs much better than competitors and introduces far less noise. That is really no justification for buying this vs a larger outdoor antenna that is built better though.<br /><br />If you are looking for the best reception possible and an antenna that is still going to be in one piece five years from now I would highly recommend one of Winegard's Platinum Series antennas. You can always add a pre-amp later on if the signal you get needs to be boosted more, but you are far better off starting with a high quality, commercial quality antenna that is located as high up as possible. Their Platinum Series antennas may not look ""cute"", but you will be a lot happier with the product in the long run.",2.0,winegard has made some great tv antennas over the years this is not one of them with radio shack out of business winegard and channel master seem to be one of the few oldschool brand names still making tv antennas these days the company has traditional manufactured both residential and commercial grade antennas that were built not only to last but to perform good enough to provide a broadcast quality picture their latest offering the winegard elite is quite a disappointment by comparisonbr br the company seems to be taking advantage of the recent rush by consumers to upgrade their big ugly outdoor antennas in favor of smaller more compact cuter looking antennas let me make one thing perfectly clear a larger better constructed antenna will always provide a better signal than a smaller one regardless of price if you have one of those huge eyesore antennas from radio shack that was installed in the s hold on to it there is no need to upgrade those antennas work just as well for hd signals as newer models and will pull in far more stations than an antenna like this willbr br there is no such thing as an hd antenna antennas do not know the difference between digital and analog there is also no such thing as k tv at least not here in the united states buying a newer antenna is not going to get you any k uhd programming because tv stations do not transmit in k period i have no idea why wingard is trying to pass off uhd reception as something that is possiblebr br to say that the construction of this device is not up to winegards normal standards is a vast understatement its build quality is horrible its overwhelmingly made of cheap plastic parts and antenna elements that are far too small to provide decent reception on the vhf band i happen to live in an area where we still have a vhf channel and the reception on this is horrible even with the builtin preampbr br why would anyone pay over for such a cheap device that looks like a million other brands made in china i have no clue its definitely not a good value proposition nor is it any better built than its cheaper chinese counterparts i suspect that the preamp likely performs much better than competitors and introduces far less noise that is really no justification for buying this vs a larger outdoor antenna that is built better thoughbr br if you are looking for the best reception possible and an antenna that is still going to be in one piece five years from now i would highly recommend one of winegards platinum series antennas you can always add a preamp later on if the signal you get needs to be boosted more but you are far better off starting with a high quality commercial quality antenna that is located as high up as possible their platinum series antennas may not look cute but you will be a lot happier with the product in the long run,2835

"Update: Battery life is TERRIBLE!  Lasted &lt; 1 month before needing to be charged. I’ve decreased the sensitivity several times (still pick up cars going by) and still only getting about one month before having to recharge. One HUGE issue that I’ve noticed is you can not customize your notifications of motion/doorbell with your Echo devices in that you either get notifications to all of your devices or none of them. My son moved into a dorm this year and took his Echo dot with him but left it tied to my Amazon account. I had to turn off all the notifications because he kept getting them at his dorm so now I don’t even get notified if someone e is at my door! I know this is a pretty unique situation but could also apply to you for instance if you have an Echo in a baby’s room. You are not going to want it announced on that Echo whenever there is motion at your door or for a doorbell. They need to make it to where you can choose which devices announce these things. Because of this (which I think is a pretty major issue for our family) and the sucky battery life, I am downgrading my rating of this from 3 to 2 stars.<br /><br />Had LOTS of trouble getting it to work properly. Wouldn’t send me ANY notifications of motion detection for over a week! Went back and forth getting tech support via email (also a big pain!). Finally started sending notifications but then was missing motion detection most of the time! Not sure what finally got it to work, but it’s working now. I get WAY too many notifications of cars driving by though and I’ve lowered the sensitivity multiple times. I feel like if I lower it much more, it’s not going to pick people up until they are on my doorstep. I’m relatively happy with it now, but overall I’m somewhat disappointed. I would recommend it, I mean now that it finally is working, I like being able to see who comes to my door, when packages are delivered, etc. But only 3 stars due to the major hassle it was took to get it to this point.",2.0,update battery life is terrible lasted lt month before needing to be charged ive decreased the sensitivity several times still pick up cars going by and still only getting about one month before having to recharge one huge issue that ive noticed is you can not customize your notifications of motiondoorbell with your echo devices in that you either get notifications to all of your devices or none of them my son moved into a dorm this year and took his echo dot with him but left it tied to my amazon account i had to turn off all the notifications because he kept getting them at his dorm so now i dont even get notified if someone e is at my door i know this is a pretty unique situation but could also apply to you for instance if you have an echo in a babys room you are not going to want it announced on that echo whenever there is motion at your door or for a doorbell they need to make it to where you can choose which devices announce these things because of this which i think is a pretty major issue for our family and the sucky battery life i am downgrading my rating of this from to starsbr br had lots of trouble getting it to work properly wouldnt send me any notifications of motion detection for over a week went back and forth getting tech support via email also a big pain finally started sending notifications but then was missing motion detection most of the time not sure what finally got it to work but its working now i get way too many notifications of cars driving by though and ive lowered the sensitivity multiple times i feel like if i lower it much more its not going to pick people up until they are on my doorstep im relatively happy with it now but overall im somewhat disappointed i would recommend it i mean now that it finally is working i like being able to see who comes to my door when packages are delivered etc but only stars due to the major hassle it was took to get it to this point,1927

"I bought one of these tablets at Best Buy, really excited to try it out and was never thoroughly excited to actually use it.

"I liked the look of these and the case, though I never got a chance to see how long the battery did last. In two days, the case was still four dots (fully charged) so that's good! The sound was decent along with noise cancellation, though I wouldn't say top of the line, it was in alignment with the cost.<br /><br />Now, the biggest issue with these which leaves them useless is the cutting in and out. I ensured these were fully charged and in the upright position per the instructions. However, when I work out or even twist them a little in my ear (since they can loosen in my ear with activity), it cuts in and out as if a poor connection (though my phone is 1 ft away from me). Then there would be no sound and I would have to tweak for a good 30 seconds to get it to have full sound again, this happened with both earbuds.

"Just a quick note: The Lepai amp is not a particularly good match for these speakers. These speakers can be bright, and the Lepai is a somewhat thin and grainy amp.<br /><br />============================================<br />Packaging Construction and Look<br /><br />(my first set came with bad woofer, and I knocked a star off for that)<br /><br />They were packed really well. There was a shipping box and then a box in a box to hold the speakers, for 3 boxes total. The speakers are held in nice thick foam with plenty of space between the speakers and the sides of the box. The speakers are wrapped in cloth bags and under the cloth bag is some thin padding. Not sure what use the bags are, except to make them seem like more expensive speakers than they are. To my mind this are over-packed, but better safe than sorry I guess.<br /><br />At first the appearance seems kind of classy. But after looking at them they start to look kind of plain, make that very plain. I'm ok with the satin/matte, but in the absence of any other kind of styling, not even a logo somewhere, it starts to look like they were sprayed with primer but didn't make it to paint.<br /><br />They have a fairly nice rubber mat on the bottom and inserts for stand or wall mounting and the quality of the finish is good and they don't look or feel cheap.<br /><br />I opened up the P4 and looked around, the woofer is a speaker with a Ferrite magnet. While it doesn't really matter to the sound, a Neodymium magnet would be indicative of a more expensive speaker. The specs on the P4 claim 3/4"" MDF, but I was able to measure the back and it not even 1/2"" thick. What they call ""heavily braced"" is actually MDF laminated together to get the thickness needed to mount the speakers and I'm assuming where the lamination is equals 3/4"". I could not evaluate the thickness of the sides, But if I had to guess from tapping/knocking on them I'd say it's the same thinner material. The speaker connectors are good quality taking bare wire or a banana jack, and are angled in such a way that the speaker can be put very close to a wall.<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Background<br /><br />These are the 3rd set of speakers I've auditioned in 3 weeks in the $150 to $250 price range in the same computer based system. Amplification was the Topping TP30 (which I recommend very highly)<br /><br />Sound source was mostly ogg/Mp3 music rips between 192kbs - 320kbs of my CD's and some, but not a lot of FLAC. Casual listening was mostly a 300 song playlist on grooveshark of songs recommended by people for speaker auditioning. Other listening was 320kbs streams from Spotify and 192kbs streams from Pandora.<br /><br />All listening was from computer desk distances in a small 10x12 room.<br /><br />In a past life I made my living for 5+ years dong live sound/stage work and some studio mix down work. I play acoustic guitar for my own enjoyment, and work on electric guitars as a hobby and for friends. I have been using some of my speaker test songs for 20+ years and listening to some of them for 30+.<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Updated 2/16/2014 after ~2 weeks of listening<br /><br />Sound review<br /><br />Note: People who really want to understand these speakers, and their problems, should read the review at noaudiophile.<br /><br />I can see why people like these speakers, but I can't like them enough to keep them.<br /><br />There is something going on in the midrange on the P4s that is not right. Male vocals hit a certain frequency and it loses something. It loses some of the 'chest' sound. Female vocals can start to sound harsh. Certain notes on an acoustic piano take on a artificial 'plinky' sound. Snare drums have too much 'crack' and not enough 'pop' if that makes sense. Guitar strings can be a bit jangly.<br /><br />This all matches up to the review at noaudiophile.<br /><br />This doesn't mean they sound horrible, it just means they don't sound right all the time. They  do bass well. It's punchy and you start rocking out in your seat and it's well controlled and defined. (I have listened to them with and without a sub)<br /><br />Depending on the music/instrumentation they can have a very pleasing sound, if at times a touch bright, but sibilance is always under control.<br /><br />After 2 weeks I have noticed a disconnect between the Woofer and Tweeter. This also matches the review at noaudiophile (which has graphs to show the hole in the frequency response)<br /><br />This bothers me, because this speakers are expensive for what they are, there shouldn't be a 'hole' in the frequency response causing the problems above.<br /><br />They are forgiving of placement, including height. Mine ended up next to my 24"" monitor with the top of the speakers about eye level and the speakers pointing straight ahead. Stereo imaging is only Ok and the do not have a strong center image, which is part of the reason my speakers ended up being placed near my monitor. This would probably improve if I toed them in, but having them pointed straight sounded better to me.<br /><br />=============================<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />In spite of the above:<br /><br />Most people will like how these speakers sound, even picky me could get used to them (well except for the disconnect between the woofer and tweeter, that still bugs me).<br /><br />But the value isn't there for me, not with a big hole in the frequency response. Steven Guttenberg can gush over these all he wants but the hole in the frequency response is there and the review at noaudiphile shows it's there. How much or how little this bothers you depends on you, how well you know your music, what other sound systems you listen on, etc.<br /><br />With the Topping Amp (the best value in an amp with a DAC) you are now in budget of $335 dollars.<br /><br />For out and out sound, I'd give them 4 stars, but that is out of respect to the good reviews that are out there for these speakers. I took star off for the bad speaker out of the box (there is no excuse for that given what these cost vs cost to make), and took 1 star off for the lack of value for the price.<br /><br />========================================<br /><br />Final thoughts<br /><br />I think the Behringer MS40 a similar size speaker is worth a hard look (the MS40 is one of the speakers I auditioned in the last month). For $100 less you get an amp, a DAC, two inputs, one digital, independent volume control of the two sources, tone controls on the front and a headphone jack.<br /><br />Unlike the P4 the Behringer the MS40 is a great deal for the money. Based on the sound, I'd have to give it to the P4s for being slightly more musical sounding, while the MS40 has a more 'studio monitor' sound but can be a bit muddy, in an area where the P4 sounds very good.<br /><br />In the same size class, while I haven't heard them but  based on reviews, I'd also give the M-Audio AV 40 some serious consideration.<br /><br />The Behringer and M-Audio show it is not that expensive to put 4 speakers in a box and have it sound good. And Behringer and M-Audio manage to get you an amp in the deal, and for a lot less money.<br /><br />Another example of what  'what-you-get' for your money, and another option, take a look (not on Amazon) is the Swan M50W. For $50 more than the P4, (less if you consider the cost of the Topping amp), you get an active 2.1 system with a seriously  attractive finish and a very sexy volume puck from a Manufacture of some very high-end speaker systems.",2.0,just a quick note the lepai amp is not a particularly good match for these speakers these speakers can be bright and the lepai is a somewhat thin and grainy ampbr br br packaging construction and lookbr br my first set came with bad woofer and i knocked a star off for thatbr br they were packed really well there was a shipping box and then a box in a box to hold the speakers for boxes total the speakers are held in nice thick foam with plenty of space between the speakers and the sides of the box the speakers are wrapped in cloth bags and under the cloth bag is some thin padding not sure what use the bags are except to make them seem like more expensive speakers than they are to my mind this are overpacked but better safe than sorry i guessbr br at first the appearance seems kind of classy but after looking at them they start to look kind of plain make that very plain im ok with the satinmatte but in the absence of any other kind of styling not even a logo somewhere it starts to look like they were sprayed with primer but didnt make it to paintbr br they have a fairly nice rubber mat on the bottom and inserts for stand or wall mounting and the quality of the finish is good and they dont look or feel cheapbr br i opened up the p and looked around the woofer is a speaker with a ferrite magnet while it doesnt really matter to the sound a neodymium magnet would be indicative of a more expensive speaker the specs on the p claim mdf but i was able to measure the back and it not even thick what they call heavily braced is actually mdf laminated together to get the thickness needed to mount the speakers and im assuming where the lamination is equals i could not evaluate the thickness of the sides but if i had to guess from tappingknocking on them id say its the same thinner material the speaker connectors are good quality taking bare wire or a banana jack and are angled in such a way that the speaker can be put very close to a wallbr br br br backgroundbr br these are the rd set of speakers ive auditioned in weeks in the to price range in the same computer based system amplification was the topping tp which i recommend very highlybr br sound source was mostly oggmp music rips between kbs kbs of my cds and some but not a lot of flac casual listening was mostly a song playlist on grooveshark of songs recommended by people for speaker auditioning other listening was kbs streams from spotify and kbs streams from pandorabr br all listening was from computer desk distances in a small x roombr br in a past life i made my living for years dong live soundstage work and some studio mix down work i play acoustic guitar for my own enjoyment and work on electric guitars as a hobby and for friends i have been using some of my speaker test songs for years and listening to some of them for br br br br updated after weeks of listeningbr br sound reviewbr br note people who really want to understand these speakers and their problems should read the review at noaudiophilebr br i can see why people like these speakers but i cant like them enough to keep thembr br there is something going on in the midrange on the ps that is not right male vocals hit a certain frequency and it loses something it loses some of the chest sound female vocals can start to sound harsh certain notes on an acoustic piano take on a artificial plinky sound snare drums have too much crack and not enough pop if that makes sense guitar strings can be a bit janglybr br this all matches up to the review at noaudiophilebr br this doesnt mean they sound horrible it just means they dont sound right all the time they do bass well its punchy and you start rocking out in your seat and its well controlled and defined i have listened to them with and without a subbr br depending on the musicinstrumentation they can have a very pleasing sound if at times a touch bright but sibilance is always under controlbr br after weeks i have noticed a disconnect between the woofer and tweeter this also matches the review at noaudiophile which has graphs to show the hole in the frequency responsebr br this bothers me because this speakers are expensive for what they are there shouldnt be a hole in the frequency response causing the problems abovebr br they are forgiving of placement including height mine ended up next to my monitor with the top of the speakers about eye level and the speakers pointing straight ahead stereo imaging is only ok and the do not have a strong center image which is part of the reason my speakers ended up being placed near my monitor this would probably improve if i toed them in but having them pointed straight sounded better to mebr br br br conclusionbr br in spite of the abovebr br most people will like how these speakers sound even picky me could get used to them well except for the disconnect between the woofer and tweeter that still bugs mebr br but the value isnt there for me not with a big hole in the frequency response steven guttenberg can gush over these all he wants but the hole in the frequency response is there and the review at noaudiphile shows its there how much or how little this bothers you depends on you how well you know your music what other sound systems you listen on etcbr br with the topping amp the best value in an amp with a dac you are now in budget of dollarsbr br for out and out sound id give them stars but that is out of respect to the good reviews that are out there for these speakers i took star off for the bad speaker out of the box there is no excuse for that given what these cost vs cost to make and took star off for the lack of value for the pricebr br br br final thoughtsbr br i think the behringer ms a similar size speaker is worth a hard look the ms is one of the speakers i auditioned in the last month for less you get an amp a dac two inputs one digital independent volume control of the two sources tone controls on the front and a headphone jackbr br unlike the p the behringer the ms is a great deal for the money based on the sound id have to give it to the ps for being slightly more musical sounding while the ms has a more studio monitor sound but can be a bit muddy in an area where the p sounds very goodbr br in the same size class while i havent heard them but based on reviews id also give the maudio av some serious considerationbr br the behringer and maudio show it is not that expensive to put speakers in a box and have it sound good and behringer and maudio manage to get you an amp in the deal and for a lot less moneybr br another example of what whatyouget for your money and another option take a look not on amazon is the swan mw for more than the p less if you consider the cost of the topping amp you get an active system with a seriously attractive finish and a very sexy volume puck from a manufacture of some very highend speaker systems,6860

"This is a frustrating product because it's so close to being great.<br /><br />The good:<br />- nice battery life<br />- controls are good and responsive<br />- the auto-on when inserted into your ear works very well<br />- I think I have weirdly shaped ear canals as it's about a 50/50 chance whether they tend to slip out. For silicone tips, that goes up to like an 80% chance of a poor fit. These lock in and don't move at all. That's great!<br /><br />All of that is offset by the terrible audio quality. The bass is decent but the mids and highs are just dreadful. Not tinny or sibilent or distant like in very cheap earbuds, though.

Standing about 4' from the camera you can barely identify a face. Any farther away than that and a face is just a pixelated mess in broad daylight.

"I am located about 30 miles to the southeast of Atlanta, Ga. I was using an RCA amplified rabbit ears to view local channels. I read the reviews on the MLU amplified indoor antenna and thought that it might perform better than my rabbit ears. So I ordered it and tried it on two of the TVs in my home. One TV is in my basement and the other one is in my living room. Over the course of a month and a half I moved the antenna all over and I was not able to out perform the rabbit ears. I was very disappointed because I was hoping to cancel my satelite service and use the MLU product to view the local channels. I would also have probably subscribed to Netflix or one of other content providers. I decided to return the product and found that the return window time period had expired. That was my fault because I kept working the antennae over time trying to find a location that would give good reception. I am 60 something years old and it takes me some time to move the product around by myself. I am sure it works for some folks from the reviews I read. It may work for you also but if it doesn't send it back within the time allowed.

"I really tried to give this unit a fair shake and wanted to like it, but I really can't recommend this given the issues I've had.<br /><br />I have two PCs, one with dual 2K screens and the other with a single 1080 screen.  On the first PC I have the second 2K monitor connected to this KVM.  So, I'm switching between the second 2K screen on PC1 and the 1080 screen on PC2<br /><br />First, the pros:<br /><br />This is a nice, compact unit.  It has a switching button on a detachable cord so the KVM can be placed out of the way and just the single cord with switch can extend out.  There is no switch on the unit itself.<br /><br />The integrated HDMI/USB PC cables work fine and are reasonably long enough (about 4 feet).<br /><br />There are bright blue indicator lights on the top of the unit to show which PC is currently connected.  If you want to see what PC is connected, however, the KVM still needs to be in view.  There is no indicator on the remote switch.<br /><br />My wireless keyboard/mouse use a single shared dongle, and I was pleasantly surprised to find when I plugged it into the mouse port both keyboard and mouse functioned fine.  This was not the case if I plugged it into the keyboard port.<br /><br />Now the cons:<br /><br />I fiddled with it for a while trying to get it to show the 2nd PC's 1080 display.  It would just remain black.  I connected the monitor directly to the PC with a good HDMI cable and it worked fine so that wasn't it.  I then tried with a DP to HDMI adapter.  Still no luck.  I was about to put it back in the box when I looked more closely at the small print in the manual and saw that you have to hold down the switcher button for 5 seconds to basically initialize the connection to a newly added display.  Voila!  Never had to do that with a KVM before nor should you have to do this for a proper functioning KVM.<br /><br />The active display occasionally goes dark for no obvious reason and I have to perform another ""sync"" by holding down the remote button for 5 seconds.  I'm just not able to realistically use this if I have to re-sync regularly.<br /><br />When I switch between PCs I hear the Windows USB connect/disconnect sound.  I'm thinking it's disconnecting the USB keyboard/mouse rather than keeping them alive when you switch.  Or maybe it's the monitor disconnecting, I can't be sure.  Either way, the KVM doesn't seem to be maintaining a device connection when you switch which shouldn't happen.<br /><br />I get that the mouse and keyboard input ports should be on the front.  But the HDMI output really should be on the back otherwise cable management becomes a bit more painful.<br /><br />There is no audio switching which I knew up front so not really a con, per se.  I could live with that but it would be nice to have.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'm honestly not too enthused about this KVM and can't really recommend it.  Others may have more luck, but in my personal setup it just doesn't meet my expectations.",2.0,i really tried to give this unit a fair shake and wanted to like it but i really cant recommend this given the issues ive hadbr br i have two pcs one with dual k screens and the other with a single screen on the first pc i have the second k monitor connected to this kvm so im switching between the second k screen on pc and the screen on pcbr br first the prosbr br this is a nice compact unit it has a switching button on a detachable cord so the kvm can be placed out of the way and just the single cord with switch can extend out there is no switch on the unit itselfbr br the integrated hdmiusb pc cables work fine and are reasonably long enough about feetbr br there are bright blue indicator lights on the top of the unit to show which pc is currently connected if you want to see what pc is connected however the kvm still needs to be in view there is no indicator on the remote switchbr br my wireless keyboardmouse use a single shared dongle and i was pleasantly surprised to find when i plugged it into the mouse port both keyboard and mouse functioned fine this was not the case if i plugged it into the keyboard portbr br now the consbr br i fiddled with it for a while trying to get it to show the nd pcs display it would just remain black i connected the monitor directly to the pc with a good hdmi cable and it worked fine so that wasnt it i then tried with a dp to hdmi adapter still no luck i was about to put it back in the box when i looked more closely at the small print in the manual and saw that you have to hold down the switcher button for seconds to basically initialize the connection to a newly added display voila never had to do that with a kvm before nor should you have to do this for a proper functioning kvmbr br the active display occasionally goes dark for no obvious reason and i have to perform another sync by holding down the remote button for seconds im just not able to realistically use this if i have to resync regularlybr br when i switch between pcs i hear the windows usb connectdisconnect sound im thinking its disconnecting the usb keyboardmouse rather than keeping them alive when you switch or maybe its the monitor disconnecting i cant be sure either way the kvm doesnt seem to be maintaining a device connection when you switch which shouldnt happenbr br i get that the mouse and keyboard input ports should be on the front but the hdmi output really should be on the back otherwise cable management becomes a bit more painfulbr br there is no audio switching which i knew up front so not really a con per se i could live with that but it would be nice to havebr br bottom line im honestly not too enthused about this kvm and cant really recommend it others may have more luck but in my personal setup it just doesnt meet my expectations,2791

"Not happy with this product at all.

"I bought this model for a trip to Australia in May after careful comparisons and research.  However, after 6 months of owning it I can say I am really unhappy with the design of the controls that turn the camera on, start the video and snap the shot. They are all grouped together at the top right of the unit. I have small hands and yet I found that on multiple occasions when I wanted to shoot a single shot I hit the video button, which is to the right of the shutter button. Once would have been an error on my part but it happened multiple times on that trip. I just came back from Churchill Canada and the same exact thing happened at least five or six times. I'm fed up with the design and intend to sell this dog on Ebay and buy myself a new camera that doesn't have the video activation 1/4 inch away from the shutter button",1.0,i bought this model for a trip to australia in may after careful comparisons and research however after months of owning it i can say i am really unhappy with the design of the controls that turn the camera on start the video and snap the shot they are all grouped together at the top right of the unit i have small hands and yet i found that on multiple occasions when i wanted to shoot a single shot i hit the video button which is to the right of the shutter button once would have been an error on my part but it happened multiple times on that trip i just came back from churchill canada and the same exact thing happened at least five or six times im fed up with the design and intend to sell this dog on ebay and buy myself a new camera that doesnt have the video activation inch away from the shutter button,815

"Absolutely NO paperwork of ANY kind included in the package.<br /><br />Pro: USB3 cable has all the proper markings<br />  Price is good<br /><br />Con: USB cable not very long.  Would be okay for a laptop.<br />  Testing shows the drive (Samsung 840 EVO is SATA 6GB) is SATA III capable; the enclosure is only SATA II.<br />  Does NOT transfer at USB 3.0 rates.<br /><br />Ability to add a 5V external supply would be nice.  The plug to the enclosure is simply a USB mini, so it is questionable of there is a true 900mA going to the box.<br /><br />The box does not mention SATA anything.  There was NO paperwork, documentation, warranty or anything inside the box.<br /><br />This shows up (with several different testing packages) as ""ADPlus SuperVer USB device.""  Whatever that is.<br />Speed testing varies with the software.  Large files write faster, as expected.  Anything from 50MB/sec to 200MB/sec.  (Yes, mega byte, not mega bit.)<br /><br />Read rate is consistently 200 MB/sec +/- 5.<br /><br />Although the case closes easily, a 9mm drive such as this causes the circuit board to tilt up until the cover goes on.  A 7mm probably would lie flat.  It does not seem to be a problem though.<br /><br />Minus 1 star for lack of SATA III throughput.  Minus another for failing to do true Superspeed USB (3.0) and no paperwork.<br /><br />***Update 9/4/2014<br />Well, not only is this not capable of USB 3.0 tfr rates, it never will be.  One simple fact: it has a USB mini connector on the enclosure.  THAT limits it to USB 2 TXMT and RCV lines.<br />The only small connector on USB devices are the MICRO!!  Those look like two connectors side by side, but they have the USB 3 SS transmit and receive lines in there.  No such thing as a mini connector in the USB 3.0 spec.  MINUS another star.<br /><br />So, although the supplied mini cable has the SS logo on the mini plug end, it is not super speed (USB 3).<br /><br />Some things just are not worth returning and this is one of those.  I'll just put a laptop SATA II spinner in it whenever it gets replaced by an SSD.<br /><br />*** Update 10/20/2014<br />  There is a new photo, description, etc. with the item.

"Picture is nice,<br /><br />The real reason I'm sending the units (I've had two) back, however, is that the player refuses to output the various high quality audio formats, including 7.1 DTS Master Audio. The digital coax cable barely works and the HDMI 2 audio output simply does not work, Admittedly I have an older receiver -- a Sony STR-DA5400ES, from 2009. But it has multiple HDMI inputs and the HDMI 2 audio output on the X800 is specifically designed to send audio to an older amp. Even Sony phone support says it should work. But it doesn't.. I spent 1 hour and 7 minutes with Sony ES support today going through every possible menu permutation on both the Amp and the UBP-X800 player. No luck The HDMI is dead. Zero output. The coax output can only send DTS EX 5.1, even though the player itself tells me it's playing DTS Master Audio 7.1.<br /><br />This UBP-X800 has two HDMI outputs: one for video, one for audio. In case you don't have a 4K receiver with the ever-changing HDMI protocols, you're supposed to be able to feed HDMI audio to the amp. So I fed the video directly to the Samsung's video input (a direct cable connection) and another HDMI to my amp.<br /><br />Zero audio from the player's HDMI audio feed. Not a peep of audio at all.<br /><br />So I used the orange RCA digital audio coax connector to get surround sound audio.<br /><br />But the coax digital audio cable only delivers DTS EX 5.1, not the 7.1 DTS Master Audio available on the Kingsman 4K disk. I updated the player's and the TV's firmware and read the manual. Nothing fixes the problem. Using all new, very short, high-speed HDMI 2.0 cables too.<br /><br />My ancient Sony BDP-S560 Blu-ray player feeds all formats to the same 5400ES amp properly. I get great 7.1 DTS Master HD audio. Thus my old Blu-ray player sounds way better than my brand new advanced Sony UHD player.<br />Researching at the Sony forum under the UBP-X800 Audio Problems thread, answers were all over the place and none worked, I tried to register so I could post my problem and the website wouldn't allow me to. The comments there were complaining that they could not get the ATMOS tracks working.<br /><br />I have no choice but to pack both X800s up and send them back.<br /><br />Eventually I found that I needed to plug the 4K player into input 3 of the TV for the image to stabilize. Interesting that only some inputs on the TV can handle UHD source. But still, the player's audio doesn't work with my Sony Amp (Sony's fault).<br /><br />HDMI was supposed to solve all these problems, but I suspect the HDCP copy protection schemes are really screwing things up or the firmware has bugs or companies just produce inferior products. Rather disappointing.",1.0,picture is nicebr br the real reason im sending the units ive had two back however is that the player refuses to output the various high quality audio formats including dts master audio the digital coax cable barely works and the hdmi audio output simply does not work admittedly i have an older receiver a sony strdaes from but it has multiple hdmi inputs and the hdmi audio output on the x is specifically designed to send audio to an older amp even sony phone support says it should work but it doesnt i spent hour and minutes with sony es support today going through every possible menu permutation on both the amp and the ubpx player no luck the hdmi is dead zero output the coax output can only send dts ex even though the player itself tells me its playing dts master audio br br this ubpx has two hdmi outputs one for video one for audio in case you dont have a k receiver with the everchanging hdmi protocols youre supposed to be able to feed hdmi audio to the amp so i fed the video directly to the samsungs video input a direct cable connection and another hdmi to my ampbr br zero audio from the players hdmi audio feed not a peep of audio at allbr br so i used the orange rca digital audio coax connector to get surround sound audiobr br but the coax digital audio cable only delivers dts ex not the dts master audio available on the kingsman k disk i updated the players and the tvs firmware and read the manual nothing fixes the problem using all new very short highspeed hdmi cables toobr br my ancient sony bdps bluray player feeds all formats to the same es amp properly i get great dts master hd audio thus my old bluray player sounds way better than my brand new advanced sony uhd playerbr researching at the sony forum under the ubpx audio problems thread answers were all over the place and none worked i tried to register so i could post my problem and the website wouldnt allow me to the comments there were complaining that they could not get the atmos tracks workingbr br i have no choice but to pack both xs up and send them backbr br eventually i found that i needed to plug the k player into input of the tv for the image to stabilize interesting that only some inputs on the tv can handle uhd source but still the players audio doesnt work with my sony amp sonys faultbr br hdmi was supposed to solve all these problems but i suspect the hdcp copy protection schemes are really screwing things up or the firmware has bugs or companies just produce inferior products rather disappointing,2516

"I've had a RAID-5 array running with four of these Spinpoint F3 (HD103SJ) drives running since 2010. Over the past four years, I've had to replace SIX of these drives. That's right, I've owned a total of NINE of these, and I've replaced ALL of the original four.<br /><br />Last year, I decided to stop wasting money on these and decided to just pay a little more for a different drive (WD Black), and today I'm running with three of the Samsung drives and one WD Black. Guess what? Two days ago, one of the remaining Samsung F3s started reporting a SMART failure. I ordered a replacement, and just today - TWO days after that Samsung F3 drive reported the SMART failure, a second Samsung F3 started reporting SMART failures, too.<br /><br />So today, I've got three Spinpoint F3 drives left, two of which are about to die. That means in four years, I will have had 8 out of 9 of these drives die. None of them have lasted more than 1 1/2 years.<br /><br />Just as a side note, I have another WD Black operating as my boot drive, a Caviar Green drive as a secondary data drive, and yet another WD Black as a final data drive (yes, my computer is a monstrosity). So of all of the drives in the system, ALL of them have held up for 2-4 years so far and the ONLY drives that have failed are these Spinpoint F3s.<br /><br />Also, I've bought the drives from a variety of sources - NewEgg, Amazon, and MicroCenter, at different times, so it's not just like I happened to buy a bunch from a bad batch.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your money.

"You could say I work for a small business.  Four guys in an office.  We actually work for a large company, but have a small local office and requested a server because corporate access was too slow over VPN to work on.  To save 300 bucks, they got this.<br /><br />Well, if you are a small business owner, forget about this thing.  There really aren't any pros, other than the small form factor and relatively inexpensive cost.  But you get what you pay for.  And to be clear, I wouldn't buy this for my house, either.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1) Google this thing.  It is NOTORIOUSLY slow.  And disaster recovery is not guaranteed if a disk is lost, or the controller goes bad.<br />3) The USB port is essentially useless.  In order to utilize it, you have to mount the drive and format it with the XFS file system.  So if you thought you were going to put backups on it, and then be able to read from your computer in an simple way, think again.  (it has to use its own power supply too, can't use a small portable hard disk).  Apparently there may be some third party options for reading this file system...but this was supposed to be ""easy"" right?<br />4) The XFS file system does not allow read-only or hidden attributes (among other things I am sure it doesn't do.)  So anything you copy to this blasts these attributes away.  So for a small business Windows implementation, this is horrible.  I alsopresume the XFS to NTFS system conversion overhead is a main driving factor in the slowness of this unit.<br />5) Security policies are clunky.  Supposedly there is a way to get this linked up.  Not sure, but we really have no control over file access at this point.  Our IT guys couldn't get it to properly NETBIOS with our network to assigned it a useable, logical name, so we access it via static IP, and no security policies.<br />6) We have this on a gigabit switch with cat6 networking.  IT IS SLOOOOOOOWW!  Google this.  We also get ""network busy"" errors periodically.  Around 10 MB/s is max.  Expect no more.  Maybe good enough to stream music, maybe movies, for a home user.  Want to transfer a few Gigs around?  Forget it.  My USB 2 drives are faster than that.  So I don't know where the f$*# these marketing sleezes came up with 72MB/s.  Maybe they meant 72Mb/s?  Big difference, guys.<br /><br />If you are a Windows user, my opinion is to build a small computer, put a small OS drive and two hard drives in it, and run synctoy a few times a day to mirror the date b/t the large hard drives for redundancy.  Networking is simple, so are fileshares and security policies, as well as all of the familiar windows file attributes and plug and play ease.  Forget RAID, and forget this thing.

I ordered this Alexa echo Dot because the description says you can make phone calls using it. Not true!  I tried calling several friends to test the claim I thought would help me in an emergency. Not one of my friends were able to get the call. I fell into voice mail with the explanation that my phone number was not known. I am in their contacts and my number is known. I immediately called  Customer Service to ask why this was happening?  The agent explained that some phone carriers like Verizon and ATT do not permit calls being placed over the internet and will block them. The only solution for me was to have all my friends contact their carriers and ask them to unblock my number.  Ridiculous!!!!  Amazon should not have made the claim that calls could be made to “most U.S phones”.  It’s simply not true.

"I would love to give this iPod model a fat five stars, but I can't bring myself to do it. The problems I have had with this product far out number the times I've actually had some enjoyment out of it. Here is what I've learned (on my 3rd iPod)<br /><br />Pros: This model holds a massive amount of songs, which means never having to delete/upload different songs you want to play. The user interface is also easy to navigate.<br /><br />Cons: If you are a Mac user, you probably love this product. However, as a Windows user, I find that the compatability issues are horrendous. I've experience, intermittent uploading, computer freezing, iPod crashes. If you own a PC, get used to seeing exclamation points on your iPod screen. And in these cases, 99% of the time the iPod will not restore.  The battery life is also very poor; you can expect to see a significant decrease in performance within the first six months of purchase. Now that I'm on my 3 iPod and my warranty is about up, I will shortly be stuck with a expensive piece of junk. Apple suggests using the 5 R's to get your iPod back on track: reset, retry, restart, reinstall, restore. These are ineffective 95% of the time so I've suggested so more helpful tips:<br /><br />Reuse: Makes a nice coffee coaster or Christmas tree ornament.<br /><br />Recycle: Better than in a landfill, right?<br /><br />Resuscitate: Compressions on any part of the click wheel are  generally more effective than what Apple suggests.<br /><br />Rock it: iPods are well-known for having more sound come out of the malfunctioning unit, than out of the headphones.<br /><br />Ruin it: Bury it in a deep hole so you won't be reminded of how much how spent on a worthless toy.<br /><br />Good luck!",1.0,i would love to give this ipod model a fat five stars but i cant bring myself to do it the problems i have had with this product far out number the times ive actually had some enjoyment out of it here is what ive learned on my rd ipodbr br pros this model holds a massive amount of songs which means never having to deleteupload different songs you want to play the user interface is also easy to navigatebr br cons if you are a mac user you probably love this product however as a windows user i find that the compatability issues are horrendous ive experience intermittent uploading computer freezing ipod crashes if you own a pc get used to seeing exclamation points on your ipod screen and in these cases of the time the ipod will not restore the battery life is also very poor you can expect to see a significant decrease in performance within the first six months of purchase now that im on my ipod and my warranty is about up i will shortly be stuck with a expensive piece of junk apple suggests using the rs to get your ipod back on track reset retry restart reinstall restore these are ineffective of the time so ive suggested so more helpful tipsbr br reuse makes a nice coffee coaster or christmas tree ornamentbr br recycle better than in a landfill rightbr br resuscitate compressions on any part of the click wheel are generally more effective than what apple suggestsbr br rock it ipods are wellknown for having more sound come out of the malfunctioning unit than out of the headphonesbr br ruin it bury it in a deep hole so you wont be reminded of how much how spent on a worthless toybr br good luck,1616

My main disappointment is with Amazon - first, for sending me an item that I believe had already been returned to them; second, they only allow 30 days to return a defective item and I am not happy about that.  And, I do not like the way this Roku 3 works, but I'm hoping it's because it was defective.

"So after many failed attempts to link with Amazon I'm making a review. The app leaves much to be desired it's total trash. I have tried linking my account via laptop etc doesn't work.<br /><br />Motion activation may work... But with the exception of 1-2x it hasn't notified me if people are by the door. The doorbell function does work as intended, however I bought this to link with Amazon and alexa so it can notify me via my echo show /studio /dot devices around the house also.<br /><br />Next we have the subject of the subscription fee. It's per device, which means if you have the 5 cameras and the doorbell your paying a lot per month. Why the hell is it not an account based system that you set up an account pay 20$ a month and you can have unlimited devices? These things don't work without wifi so if the power goes out they are useless as a security system.<br /><br />My suggestion for people is buy a standalone camera setup with recorder. You can even set most up for remote login via your phone, several are internet connected and can notify you if there's motion. Sure some are more expensive but don't think for a minute this is cheap vs those. What those cost up front this will rack up in the long term with subscription fees.

"Update: I have changed my 5-star review to a 1-star. This unit just stopped working; it wouldn't read a battery at all. I don't know how the ones I've given to family and friends are holding up, but this unit is dead. Quite frustrating. I won't be buying any more of this type of battery tester.<br /><br />I've lost count of how many I've bought and shared with friends and family.  Since my first purchase years ago, I've considered this little tester to be an essential tool in my tool box. The tester itself has no batteries. It has contact points that you line up with a battery's contact points. The digital display shows you the volts the battery has. Or doesn't have—a completely dead battery doesn't register anything, so all you see is a blank screen. You'll also get a blank-screen display if the contacts aren't lined up correctly. This tool has saved me money by showing me which batteries still have a full charge and which need to be discarded. I've used it for all sizes of the ""button"" batteries, 9-volt batteries, and for sizes AAAA to D flashlight-type batteries.<br /><br />It's also highly effective in getting rid of guests who don't know when to go home. Pull out the battery tester and a container of batteries, and say ""Hey, guys, want to see something cool??"" Then proceed to test each battery, enthusing over the reading and making sure each person gets to see the tiny screen for themselves.
